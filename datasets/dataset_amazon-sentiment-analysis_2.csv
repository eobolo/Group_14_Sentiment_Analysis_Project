I live near Las Vegas in Southern Utah and I can't connect through Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco or even Seattle my closest server is Atlanta or Mexico City which means I get a slower connection to the internet and limits file sharing an 4k video when using the VPN however when traveling to Europe I wasn't able to stream any videos or pictures on my Delta flight after paying $50 for the privilege of having internet access on my 10 hour flight. The reason I paid the $50 was to watch Netflix and You Tube I was a bit upset by the extremely slow connection then I remembered I had installed Tunnel Near on my Galaxy Note 10+ for which I had an external screen, so I switched on Tunnel Bear connected through Atlanta and presto I was suddenly able to surf the internet and watched videos and movies from all my streaming apps in 1080P with no buffering throughout my entire flight. Amazing. I guess Delta throttles it's internet connection to the point of making it unusable to customers even after they suck $50 from your bank account completely ripping customers off for there hard earned dollars but my Tunnel Bear saved me from this horrible scam because they can't throttle your internet connection while using VPN like Tunnel Bear. Tunnel Bear works great in Europe and has servers all over the place in Europe so when I was blocked from using Discover+ outside the US I simply connected through Atlanta again and streamed My Cat from Hell and I got to watch on my portable 15.6 in screen in 1080P with no buffering by connecting my screen to the phone using the Dex feature and a USB-C data cord (I can connect my phone and use it as like a desktop using the Dex feature either wirelessly or through USB-C and it works flawlessly on most devices except my Roku where there is a 2 second deley for some reason making it next to impossible to use my mouse I have tried both my expensive Roku devices and have the same problem the audio doesn't sync properly to the video either I can mirror cast to the Roku but the screen on the phone is 2 sec or more ahead of the phone screen and it's definitely the Roku and not my phone because wireless casting works perfectly with my Fire stick and my Vizio smart TV and Roku has no support for the problem online. My advice get a FireTV device for casting not a Roku.) That said I highly recommend Tunnel Bear for it's extremely low price it is a great value and works pretty well but not as well as others such as Nord VPN which costs a lot more money.","RYCJ7HVRN8Z3F",,,,,,,,,,,"3 people found this helpful","Very affordable VPN","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYCJ7HVRN8Z3F/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PGLHKM8","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2022",,,"amzn1.account.AEW66YDK4S2X7CQYE4TDVATIPRIA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEW66YDK4S2X7CQYE4TDVATIPRIA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B07PGLHKM8",,,,,,

With the new bottle opener, I wouldn't recommend putting it in your pants pocket, it catches easily. The bottle opener itself seems to work well without adding unnecessary flourishes to the tool. One complaint I had before and still is that it's a little cumbersome to open one-handed, although now you could potentially practice hooking onto the bottle opener. Unlike the previous version, though, this one locks in place when open, and immediately feels safer because of it. I feel comfortable gripping a little tighter around the body knowing the blade isn't going to chop down on my finger. There's a little thumb catch to release the lock and close it back up.

The reason I specifically loved this one is I was a boy who liked cartoon men and monsters who wanted a power rangers cd- something I could study that was an unusual color like purple or pink. This album is nasty- I've Had Boyfriends Before and the ingredients list based reality of what this is - is very Nasty. I Do want this published because I think it's incredible that a man can play these songs in a power rangers costume and not be called dino-core-but I will say-The electronic/vocal passage on dangerous sounds like being locked in a room with shaggy during an led lights Beer party. There are heavy riffs that sound very aqua monster as in To Say like VEnom- it sounds very intentional- it wouldn't make sense for it not to be based on the research I've done? Otherwise- it's very unique, honestly. The closest comparison I can think of is the 1975, but interestingly enough, this one feels a lot less like queer bait. There's an American Football based passage on gethsemane - but - it's very successfully not gross (I'm pretty sure the riffs on that album are supposed to be). All of the metal moments are great.

This album is so interesting to hear with the musical breakdowns and change ups.  Different styles; hip hop, rap, jazz, electric, pop, metal it’s got it all.  Every musician is fantastic and they do the deity known as Sleep a reverential ritual every song.  This feels like a very emotionally revealing album for the band and it works brilliantly.  I bought the CD form which is great except I wish the lyrics were posted but they are not.  Very bare bones slip with band name and record label.

I was looking for a modest priced, high(ish) resolution Ring camera that allowed remote viewing and exceptional motion detection both during day and night. For previous battery/rechargeable Ring models (cameras and doorbells), I don’t think they had the ability to remote view or record full motion (before and after an event), but this camera can! Wiring electricity to power a camera in my back yard was out of the question, so theoretically, this no wire, rechargeable camera was the perfect solution for my need.Setting up the camera with the Ring app was simple, as was configuring and installing the wall mount.Recharging the battery was confusing at first, mainly because I initially skipped the instructions pamphlet. Essentially the battery slides out of the camera and is directly charged by a mini usb (hdmi) cord (which is included, just no power block). This means the camera never needs taken off of the wall mount. The bottom of the camera can be unlocked and twisted off, allowing you to slide the battery out to recharge. Recharging can be a potential inconvenience, especially if the location you’d like to monitor has a lot of activity (like a GANG OF NEIGHBORHOOD CATS). Side note, the cats were not the reason I bought this—in fact I wasn’t aware of their morning shenanigans until after installing this.With that said, because I came in a little under budget with this camera, I did opt to order the mountable solar panel to hopefully extend the battery life and/or eliminate the need to recharge this camera’s battery altogether. Once it’s delivered and operating for a bit, I plan on updating this review.Overall, for the price, I definitely am pleased with the quality and responsiveness of the camera and am looking forward to see how it holds charge with the solar panel. If you’re looking for a Ring camera that does not need hardwired and like to have the ability to record, remote view, and have accurate motion detections, this camera may in fact be for you!","R1Q5RZ3EDVYS1K",,,,,,,,,,,"58 people found this helpful","I’m so grateful this was released","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q5RZ3EDVYS1K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D23XCB6C","Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFMDWBZVVLGUF3DQC4E5DTQ2VGEA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMDWBZVVLGUF3DQC4E5DTQ2VGEA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: White, Size: 1 Camera, Configuration: Battery","B0D23XCB6C","Color","White","Size","1 Camera","Configuration","Battery"

If you look at the advertising for this 2K camera, it only advertises you can view things in 2K and nowhere does it state that it records in 1080, which I feel is misleading because one would assume it also records in 2k.

Originally, French director Adrien Maben had an idea to film ""The Floyd"" (as they were referred to back in the day) in front of classical paintings. The band rejected the idea. After quite a bit of time had passed and the director and the band had still not managed to meet, he went on holiday to Pompeii with his wife. Sometime during his walks around the ruins, he lost his passport. Returning there in the evening to search for it, he found himself inspired by the stillness of the ruins and its atmosphere. Thus was born an idea. Contacting The Floyd again, he proposed that he film them live amongst the ruins in the Roman Ampiheater of Pompeii. They liked the idea and agreed. One of the city council memebers was a Floyd fan in Pompeii, and he convinced the city's elders to do the unprecedented: Allow a rock band to perform and record amongst the ruins of the ancient city. No one would be allowed to do so again for 45 years until, David Gilmore, by then a legend, came back and performed an actual concert in Pompeii at the same site in 2016. This is also available on Blu Ray, BTW .Despite his initial good fortune, Maben's troubles began.  Maben soon discovered that the cables he had run out to the Ampitheater where gladiators once battled were inadequate for the massive power supplies needed, and ultimately he had to run a massive cable all the way back to the city of modern Pompeii with persons posted to guard it. His one week of filming was now down to 3 or 4 days. Still, he wanted to create an ""anti-Woodstock."" The trend had been to record a band live with the audience becoming another member. In THIS case, Pink Floyd would be performing only to the crew, and we viewers would be their audience--along with a few children who managed to sneak in (one of my friends' cousins in Vico Equense recounted how he snuck in with his friends.) Even in early October, the band perfomed under the burning sun, resorting to even filming some night time shots perhaps because the ampitheater was so much cooler. It also made for some very creative use of lighting to have Waters and Gimour appear and disapppear. Track shots and varius techniques showed the band walking along Veusvius (and Etna?) and when the film was intitally shown, despite good reviews Adrien Maben decided it was a bit too short. He also filmed the band doing some more performances in Paris and rehearsing back in Abbey Road Studies, where they would work for the next year experimenting and recording what would become thier number one album, THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON--selling over 50 million copies, and staying on the billboard top 200 for 741 weeks- over 14 years. This second release in 1974 would become the definitve theatrical Pompeii film. For years growing up, I would go over to friend's parties. In those darkened parent’s living rooms we would hang our with our girl friends and watch this film on low res VHS tapes. The audio often wouldn't track well. Eventually I would pick up my own ""HI FI"" stereo copy of the film -that was still new technology. Later,I would snag a much better looking release on Laserdisc in my quest for the perfect copy. Finally, in the early 2000's the film was released on DVD. Alas it was a new, ""Director's Cut."" Usually, I prefer these cuts in movies, but in this case it was far inferior, and picture quality is middling. Maben added video game-like computer graphics, very dated looking even for then,  cutting away from the band and distracting from the film. Additional inteviews that he shot in 16mm black and white were added, but they only served to slow down the film. Digging into the sub menus, one could find the first cut of the film- but it is only the performances. Interviews with Nick mason ordering breakfast, “I’ll have egg, sausage, chips and beans – and a tea,” and  seeking in vain a pie without the crust. Along with the band’s reminiscences, Waters arguing about over active imaginations hearing a sibilance on a second cut of Obscured by Clouds ( foreshadowing their later acrimonious  breakup), and some very stoned and funny commentary by Gilmour and Waters, the former assuring us that they are not a ""Drug-orientated group. Trust us"" while being very red-eyed and obviously stoned, had audiences laughing quite strongly. None of that was visible on the DVD as a fluid cut. One could also find an interview with driector Maben, which is unfotunately not available on this release. What is available is a MUCH sharper (Finally) higher resolution presentation, with the same cut much as I saw on VHS, Laserdic, and finally in IMAX at the theaters last week, which should please most buyers. Unfortunately, they did not make the film available in 4K UHD, I suspect beacause they think that demand might not warrant it, but this copy is the highest quality home release we Floyd fans have ever had. Acoustically, much as in the IMAX presentation, this cut is a revelation. The soundtracks are available in three flavors:  2.0 uncompressed LCPM: linear pulse coded Modulation, which is the highest possible quality for a two channel stereo presentation and probably close to how it was originally presented in the best theaters back in the 70's. You also have 5.1 Dolby True HD surround, and Dolby Atmos, in which if you have the right speaksers and set up sounds will seem to emanate from your ceilings as well as to be a totally emersive wrap around experience. I had my head cocked and turning behind me in the  theater as I could hear Richard Wright and Dave Mason's separate voicies behind me, as well as sound swirling around the theater. The famed Steve Wilson has done an amazing job remixing and cleaning up these old recordings, which sound like today's best reference grade audio; that’s no small achievement for a 53 year old film. Subtitles are available in German, Italian, Spanish, and others- but no English, and they are limited to speech and not whilst singing, as is typical of most concert discs, unfortunately. The film is both surprising, at times humorous, and strangely meserizing, with Maben's tracking shots around drummer Nick Mason, and other cuts of the band bringing us into a near trance-like state. Images of frescos from ancient Pompeiian homes, and statues seem erie and fit in with shots of the city and the music, making for a unique experience. I would not throw out my old copy just for the additional interviews and Maben's commentary, but this is clearly the superior and only copy to have if you wish to see Pink Floyd in concert as they were intended to be seen. Online you can find an audio only recording of Nick Mason and Steven Wilson discussing the film after watching it with audience on its 2025 premiere. I’ve waited 40 years to see this properly released. Highly recommended.","R35NGOA4R8RE0A","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81x1Kl9o5JL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gsxQ0NXhL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FebKfDdvL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uUDJbnetL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"26 people found this helpful","FINALLY!

Essentially, you have two main choices here. One is to go directly to the (non-live) concert at the Pompeii Amphitheatre. Here you will be astonished by individual and group creative process leading to the vinyl release. Alternatively, you go the same plus several inserts showing material from interviews to all members of the band. These exchanges are interesting as the reflect differences in personality when it comes to how strong or well-founded provide opinions.Finally, but not least, the images are also astonishing when it comes to the historical Pompeii images.Should I mention a negative issue, it you are interested in the blu ray release exclusively, the package is a bit disappointing.

En octobre 1971, Pink Floyd a déjà 5 albums à son actif et a terminé « Meddle » qui sortira à la fin du mois, un de leurs chefs d’œuvre, sans doute leur premier. Toujours en quête d’innovation, le groupe demande au réalisateur Adrian Maben de les filmer lors d’un concert sans public dans les ruines de l’amphithéâtre de Pompéi. « Une sorte d’anti-Woodstock » selon les termes de Maben, une expérience comme l’appelle les membres du groupe, misant sur la qualité sonore obsessionnelle du groupe, plutôt que « les réactions du public ». Les prises de vues sont réalisées du 4 au 7 octobre. Puis de nouvelles sessions sont enregistrées du 13 au 20 décembre à Paris pour compléter le tournage de Pompéi qui a subi quelques problèmes techniques mais qui démontraient aussi que le groupe avait de l’humour et du second degré (« Mademoiselle Nobs », blague sympa enregistrée…avec une chienne !). Une version audio remasterisée existait déjà dans le coffret « The Early Years 1972 » en 2016 avec 5 titres et la version alternative de « Careful with that axe, Eugene ». Cet enregistrement est donc loin d’être une découverte. Mais 2025 est l’occasion d’avoir (enfin) une version remixée en audio (2 CD) et vidéo, et pas par n’importe qui car il s’agit de Steven Wilson, musicien passionnant mais aussi un excellent ingénieur du son toujours sur les bons coups, permettant de redécouvrir quelques-uns des groupes qui l’ont influencé et lui font confiance pour le meilleur rendu sonore possible (Pink Floyd bien sûr mais aussi King Crimson, Marillion, Yes, The Who, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull…). A chaque fois, il frappe fort. Ici le son de chaque instrument ressort fabuleusement, en particulier la batterie de Mason, aucune comparaison avec la version d’origine ou même celle de 2016, le remixage était utile. Il faut dire que le son stéréo du documentaire était juste correct.Ce « Live at Pompeii » représente vraiment une charnière dans la carrière de Pink Floyd. Pas encore devenu le mastodonte qu’il sera à peine 2-3 ans plus tard, le groupe joue encore dans un style post-psychédélique avec une approche toujours expérimentale mais commence à s’en éloigner pour aller ailleurs. « A saucerful of secrets » offre l’occasion à Gilmour de triturer sa guitare comme jamais, tandis que Wright martèle son piano, que Waters s’acharne sur le gong, et que Mason n’en finit plus de frapper ses fûts. Le final du morceau tire plus vers le prog’ presque symphonique, dans une apothéose entre les claviers de Wright et la voix de Gilmour. Ce dernier sait tout aussi bien chanter d’une voix puissante ou éthérée, que distiller une atmosphère mystérieuse comme dans le lancinant « Careful with That Axe, Eugene ». Ambiance planante que vient rompre Waters par son cri strident et toujours aussi terrifiant. Des morceaux qu’on trouvait déjà dans le disque live de « Ummagumma », et qui appartiennent donc à la « première période » du groupe. Mais on sent un changement, une mutation… Si « Atom heart mother » marquait déjà la transition entre les sixties et seventies, mettant fin en quelque sorte au versant le plus psychédélique et expérimental du groupe, cette fin d’année 1971 annonce clairement les grandes heures du Floyd. Quand il joue le morceau en ce début du mois d’octobre à Pompéi, le groupe n’a pas encore sorti « Meddle » où figure la version studio de « Echoes ». Il arrivera dans les bacs quelques semaines plus tard. C’est donc presqu’un « inédit », au moins pour l’équipe de tournage. Cependant, cette pièce épique était en gestation depuis plusieurs mois, et était déjà jouée en concert depuis quelques mois. D’abord appelée « Nothing » (« rien »), puis « The son of nothing » (« le fils de rien ») et enfin « The return of the son of nothing » (« le retour du fils de rien ») en forme de boutade, cette suite de plusieurs idées musicales trouve son aboutissement en une longue symphonie rock. Mais à la différence de « Atom heart mother », le morceau « Echoes » comporte une partie chantée, et se joue uniquement avec le groupe, sans apport extérieur d’orchestre ou de chorale. Une pièce sublime qui préfigure l’apogée de Pink Floyd dans les années 70, de « The Dark side of the moon » à « The wall ». Pour ceux et celles qui souhaitent découvrir ce concert unique, je conseille d’abord la version vidéo très prenante mais pour les fans cette version audio est fantastique.

Solo l'idea di ascoltare i Pink Floyd risuonare tra le antiche rovine di Pompei evoca un'atmosfera magica e potente, e questo disco sembra catturare proprio quell'essenza.UN'ESPERIENZA ACUSTIC UNICAConsiderando che si tratta di una registrazione del 1972, ci si può aspettare un suono che, pur non essendo tecnicamente perfetto come le produzioni moderne, possieda un calore e una profondità unici, tipici delle registrazioni analogiche di quell'epoca. Immagino che l'eco naturale dell'anfiteatro romano possa aver contribuito a creare un'esperienza acustica irripetibile, aggiungendo un senso di spazialità e grandezza alle performance dei brani.UN PEZZO DA COLLEZIONE PER GLI APPASSIONATIIl formato in doppio LP rende questo prodotto un oggetto da collezione di sicuro valore per i fan dei Pink Floyd e per gli amanti della musica in vinile. La cura nella presentazione e la possibilità di possedere fisicamente un documento sonoro di un evento così leggendario aggiungono un fascino particolare a questo disco. È un modo per rivivere un momento storico della musica rock e per apprezzare l'arte di una band che ha saputo trascendere i generi.UN'IMMERSIONE NELLA LEGGENDAAnche per chi non ha familiarità con la performance originale, ascoltare questo disco può rappresentare un'occasione unica per immergersi nell'atmosfera di quel concerto straordinario. La musica dei Pink Floyd, con le sue atmosfere psichedeliche e i suoi paesaggi sonori evocativi, si sposa perfettamente con la solennità e la bellezza antica di Pompei, creando un'esperienza d'ascolto che va oltre la semplice riproduzione musicale.","R38C70HOV0TKL9",,,,,,,,,,,,"Un Viaggio Sonoro Emozionante nel Cuore di Pompei",,"Reviewed in Italy on May 12, 2025",,,,,"","B0DXWG3DCB",,,,,,

When I went to  Pinnacle website there was only the option to buy the software but no option  to download it after purchasing it from Amazon. I then contacted Amazon customer service three times via chat to get instructions on how to download the software. They were unable to provide step by step instructions . I was given an Amazon links but it did not resolve the issue.I then went online to find out what the process was .  I found instructions on the Amazon website which stated to go to my orders , find the software purchased and  there should be a download option next to the order . Tried this but could not find any download option next to the order . I even looked in the digital downloads section and software library but still could not find this purchase.  I literally spent almost two hours trying to download the software but no avail.I will again state that I prefer the original way to install software , receiving  a cd installation  disk.

Otherwise- it's very unique, honestly. The closest comparison I can think of is the 1975, but interestingly enough, this one feels a lot less like queer bait. There's an American Football based passage on gethsemane - but - it's very successfully not gross (I'm pretty sure the riffs on that album are supposed to be). All of the metal moments are great. It's super fun. The hard back case is beatiful- I love a solid plastic case. And it's literally purple with flags and swords and stuff.","R3R2D77RZ94YAC",,,,,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","This Album is finally here","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R2D77RZ94YAC/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DZQLPBG4","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGYOI7ECM3DW6HR5RPP46DOZZHEA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYOI7ECM3DW6HR5RPP46DOZZHEA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DZQLPBG4",,,,,,

Every musician is fantastic and they do the deity known as Sleep a reverential ritual every song.  This feels like a very emotionally revealing album for the band and it works brilliantly.  I bought the CD form which is great except I wish the lyrics were posted but they are not.  Very bare bones slip with band name and record label.

I think the last one was Springsteen’s Letter To You. And in some ways, this is Elton’s Letter To You. A letter to us. It’s a return to form, inspired by lifetime fan Brandi Carlisle. It does not merely avoid embarrassment, but successfully rolls back the years. And it deserves better than the one or two sentences most folks have written. Look, I’m a huge Elton John fan since 1970 when I chased his limousine down Broadway in NYC following an appearance on the Dick Cavitt show (!) I played (and play) piano, And in my high school and college years Elton made me a legitimate rock musician. Honky Chateau and Don’t Shoot Me changed my life. And Someone Saved My Life Tonight became biographical. His music was the soundtrack to my life. I’ve never missed a release. Some in my mind have soared (The One, Songs From The West Coast) others remained intriguing for a song or two (Less Than Zero anyone?) But I’ve always loved him. (And there's a great easter egg embedded in the title song!) So I think that this album deserves better than the one or two sentences most have written so far. So here are my thoughts:1. The Rose Of Laura Nyro opens the album in the manner of GYBR’s Funeral For A Friend. A large, sprawling melodic swell that may not quite be the masterwork described by Bernie Taupin (in the liner notes) but will surely give you a sense of “Hey, this is going to be all right”.2. Little Richard’s Bible is (not surprisingly) a stompin’ rocker about the legendary flamboyant bouffant-ed  rock’n’roller turned preacher. (Wish Andrew left Alton's laughter at the end in the finished mix) Elton kicks ass - indeed!3. Swing For The Fences really does swing! Accurately described as a true collaboration, the voices blend beautifully in this ode to hope, optimism, and joy. This is one my wife and I have started to sing and boogie to in the privacy of our own home! (Remember, I was a fan in 1970!) This was a song Brandi & Elton wrote with their kids in mind. It's true for kids of ALL ages! Great stuff - and if you don't find yourself inexplicably screaming out ""Suffragette!"" during the closing bars, wel,, you just weren't there. WYKYK.4. Never Too Late - This one feels like generic filler - even though it was nominated for an Oscar last year. Nice thoughts are expressed, but this one doesn't linger in my memory, though it does evoke a little taste of Tiny Dancer. Just me.5. You Without Me is pure Brandi. It would have fit perfectly on her great  2021 disc In These Silent Days. Beautifully harmonizing with herself, it demands to be listened to with open ears. Elton’s voice won’t be missed, though he plays gently in the background.  And I say that with all respect to both artists. Read the story behind the song in the booklet. It’s lovingly heartbreaking. Any parent who has struggled with the increasing independence of their adolescent child will surely relate. Kids grow up.6. Who Believes In Angels is the first masterpiece on the album. Classically melodic, with a lovely keyboard counter melody and an absolutely classic Elton John bridge, this song soars. And when Brandi’s voice takes off (“What will the angels do with you and I?”) soaring as Elton’s did 50 years ago I dare you not to feel reverberations of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Reverberations from an echoed memory, not from Elton “recycling” an older melody. This tune stands on its own. And here's the Easter Egg. Elton was inspired by Leon Russell. They recorded the album The Union together in 2010.  It meant the world to Leon, who surprised Elton with the closing song In The Hands Of Angels. The angels were Elton's manager and Sir Elton himself, referred to as ""the governor"". This song - Who Believes in Angels - has a powerful bridge, and during its final, powerful singing of the line Elton plays a slightly deepened, slightly louder bass line - of D-E-F-F#-G The same notes, in the same rhythm as Russell's immortal opening to his well known song, Delta Lady. Brilliant.7. The River Man starts off like a ballad duet before evolving into an all out rocker, with a little nod to Elton’s recording of Pinball Wizard along the way.  God, I’d love to hear The Stones cover this one! (Andrew you can make this happen!)8. A Little Light - A soulful duet. A lovely “the world’s a mess (Elton) but things will be alright (Brandi)” type of song. I find myself singing this one sometimes throughout the day. “Let a little light on in the world”. Indeed.9. Someone To Belong To - OK. This is a pretty generic, pleasant song that probably would have worked well as the album’s closer. But wait…there’s one more.10. When This Old World Is Done With Me - Oh my. This is the song that brought Sir Elton himself to tears during the recording sessions. Elton feels this song deeply in his bones. It’s his life. And his voice sounds strong and assured. The chords are simply played in a 4/4 rhythm. “Release me like an ocean wave / return me to the tide”. It evokes The Diving Board and all that THAT album (apparently heard by no one but me ;) tried to convey. But now its personal. It brought Elton to tears, as it did to me. As it possibly will for you.What else? Well, kudos to Andrew Watt for his production. And guitar playing. But especially for his production. This was such an easy project to screw up. It could have sounded stylistically too old. Or too “affected” and too new. It could have been Paul Buckmaster- ed to death with either of these artists. Watt resisted the temptation to do any of this, instead choosing to honor each artists known voice and blending them perfectly with backings that complement rather than distract. You Without Me is appropriately bare bones. The first couple of songs on the album are wonderfully bombastic without without taste. It’s well done.You owe it to yourself to own this album if you are a fan of either of these two artists. Having said that, I really have to salute Sir Elton. His voice sounds fluid and strong, and more importantly he sounds more emotionally involved with this material than he has sounded in many years. Family has centered him. Perhaps the Glen Campbell duet that closes The Lockdown Sessions, along with his recent health concerns have brought him face to face with his mortality. Regardless, his musicianship, his philanthropy, his generosity and humanity (yes, even though I’ve seen Tantrums & Tiaras and his shredding of Brandi’s lyric sheet) all add to the great gift that he - and Bernie, and Andrew L-W - have given to this world.He certainly has been a gift to me. Hey - I’m learning these new songs just as I did 55 years ago. And I’ll play them with undimmed enthusiasm and enjoyment. Just as Elton and Brandi sing for us on this album.

Yes, I'm a lifelong fan, but I also expect a lot from Elton and the choices he makes both in his music and his collaborators, from duets (think John Lennon, George Michael, etc.) to full-on collaborations like The Union with the legendary Leon Russell and now this, with the preternatural Brandi Carlisle. The pairing here is brilliant and the result is incredible. Every song is excellent in its own right and each has become an earworm that comes out of nowhere throughout the course of any given day. That the songs also tell stories -- of the artists, their heroes, their families, and even of the collaboration itself -- adds even greater depth to the musical mastery. If you own ANY Elton or Brandi records, add this one to your collection. It will not disappoint. Bravo!","R10V4DZMZ80MCC",,,,,,,,,,,"7 people found this helpful","Brilliant Artists.

That’s the good part.The part I don’t really like is that this feels more like this is Brandi’s album that features Elton. Her voice is much more prominent thruout the album. My problem with her is over the past few years she has seemed to shoehorn herself into every legends album or appearance. Joni Mitchell, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Tanya Tucker, various Rock Hall inductions, etc, she’s there for all of them. And now Elton.It’s not a bad album, but as I said it feels more like Brandi Carlile wanted to make an album inspired by Elton John and this is it, only she got him to sing and play on it as well.","R1C4VFGNBPOQ9N",,,,,,,,,,,"8 people found this helpful","More like Brandi Carlile featuring Elton John","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C4VFGNBPOQ9N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DSQ9XTWS","Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AE67XRPIH2QNQHPDZGJQOEOOCX4Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE67XRPIH2QNQHPDZGJQOEOOCX4Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DSQ9XTWS",,,,,,

I like it, but it's a room lamp. This lamp is more of an 'area' lamp. It would be good for sitting next to your couch or chair. In my case I use it next to my art desk and bend the gooseneck directly over my work when I paint or when I photograph my paintings. At its highest it's still best when used as a seating lamp as opposed to a tall, full-size lamp.It has both a remote control and buttons on the unit itself. The unit buttons are + and - for brighter or dimmer, a power on/off button and a 'CCT' button which adjusts in order of cool, neutral (cool-warm combo) warm, and warmest. My larger lamp has more hue options, but this is still plenty for my needs.One thing I really like about this model is the ability to swing the top-only portion of the lamp to use it above my workspace and then swing it out of my way when done without having to turn the entire base of the lamp. Speaking of the base, another thing I like is that the base has a very small footprint which tucks easily under the edge of furniture. The lamp head is also fairly small at just over 6"", so make sure you realize that this is a smaller, more petite version than other similar styles. I have no complaints, I'm very happy with this lamp.","R5H5973SNC0XQ",,,,,,,,,,,,"Smaller and Lower Size; Great for a Seated Work Light","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5H5973SNC0XQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DP7C3XK9","Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGYKFTNNEBG6POISSRXFP6OFWP3Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYKFTNNEBG6POISSRXFP6OFWP3Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DP7C3XK9",,,,,,

You can move the gooseneck around pretty freely, and the height adjustment makes it easy to fit wherever you need it. The lamp itself is super bright, but also dimmable, which is a big plus depending on the time of day or what you're doing.What I didn’t expect — and was a nice surprise — is the little mood light feature. I didn’t even notice it when ordering, but it adds this soft glow that actually gives the office a cozy, almost lounge-y vibe in the evenings. My wife likes to use that setting when she’s winding down or on a late Zoom call.The remote and touch controls are also really handy (no need to fumble around for switches), and overall it feels like a quality build — doesn’t wobble or feel cheap.Definitely glad we grabbed this one.

Efficiency for the win.Overall, as you can see from the pictures, this is a bit larger than the adapters I have which don't include the USB ports, but it's not as large as a travel adapter AND a phone charger. Plus this comes with it's own travel pouch, to help keep it protected in my personal item bag.It would be nice if the manufacturer would provide the information about how the USB ports will split up the power when more than one is in use. For me, the fact that they don't provide this is the biggest negative about this product.  Here were my results from a quick non-scientific test:My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. It will show one of four charging statuses: Super fast charging which requires a 45 Watt charger, fast charging which happens with a 25 Watt charger, charging which happens with a normal 15 Watt charger, and slow charging which seems to happen at under 15 Watts but I couldn't find any documentation which specified what exact wattages would cause the phone to display this.When using either one of the USB C ports individually, my Galaxy S22 Ultra would display that it was ""super fast charging"".When using both USB C ports simultaneously, with one port charging my earbuds, the phone plugged into the other port would only show ""charging"", so it skipped past the ""fast charging"" status which tells me that the wattage is somewhere under 15 Watts.I got the same results when using the USB A plugs to charge other devices while keeping the phone plugged into either of the USB C ports.So it's evident that the use of more than one USB port at a time will reduce your charging speeds fairly dramatically. However, this is true of ALL multiport chargers I've seen. It would just be nice if Epicka would provide the specific details.The true use for this device, though is to function as a plug adapter so that you can use plugs from one country in outlets in another country. It is NOT a voltage converter, though, so it's only intended to be used with devices that can handle any voltage between 110 and 220. If you plug in something that's intended for 110 volts into this and you're in a country where the voltage is 220, you're probably going to fry whatever it is that you plugged in.However, this does come with a fuse, that might help protect your devices, as well as a backup fuse if you blow the first one. I would not rely on this though. Only plug in something you know will work with the voltage at your location.Bottom line: I'm very satisfied with this product. It works great as both a wall adapter so that I can use my devices in other countries and as a USB charger for my phone and other electronics, which saves me from having to bring two separate devices.

First off, the look is sleek and modern, and it instantly upgraded the vibe of my living room. It’s low-profile, so it doesn’t hang down like an old-school helicopter blade threatening your head. It’s more like a stylish fandelier with a PhD in comfort.The fan has 6 speeds, which is great because now I can choose between ��gentle mountain breeze” and “hold onto your toupee.” The reversible motor is a game-changer—cool air in summer, warm air in winter—and it runs whisper quiet. Seriously, it’s so quiet I had to check twice to make sure it was actually on.What I love most is the smart control. I can control it from the remote or my phone, which means I can adjust the speed or lighting without moving from my couch—or bed—because we all know that’s when the laziness hits hardest. The app is intuitive, and it even remembers your last settings, which feels like a small but mighty act of love from a fan.And the lighting? Perfection. Smooth dimming from 10% to full daylight, with three color temps depending on whether I’m working, relaxing, or pretending to host a cooking show. The 600 LED beads really light up the space evenly—no weird shadows or flickering.Installation was straightforward, and most parts were pre-assembled. Even for a DIY-er with the patience of a squirrel like me, it took under an hour to get everything up and running.  The instructions were very detailed and easy to follow.Bottom line: this ceiling fan/light is quiet, powerful, smart, stylish, and saves me from climbing out of bed to turn off the lights. 10/10 would install again—if only I had more ceilings!","R3KY3J7AU157OV","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ND8LTLZqL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713j01J387L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NQQ2iDwAL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,"6 people found this helpful","A cool looking fan with brains and beauty.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KY3J7AU157OV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DZSHVVTZ","Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHKPD736BBRU5CFAQ5DN3IUR3HVQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKPD736BBRU5CFAQ5DN3IUR3HVQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: white","B0DZSHVVTZ","Color","white",,,,

With the ease of a remote, you can turn this on and off, dim and brighten the light, and control the speed of air flow on the fan. On the highest setting, it kicks off seriously bright light and powerful air flow. A couple of added bonuses are the fact it's rather quiet even at the highest setting, and you can use the fan without the light on. This is great for me because I love the white noise at night.4. Ceiling fans can run upwards of a few hundred dollars so this was a great value.

Recently, I had to do a hard reset on my computer which erased all memory and unfortunately I did not have my serial # to reinstall the Corel dvd. So I was hesitant to purchase this newer version with all the mixed reviews. However, I took a chance, installed this 2023 version and what a relief!! The interface is pretty much the same and I was able to edit my first comical video within minutes and share with family and friends. I trust the Corel brand and love their product. When I first was exposed to them in 2016, it took some studying and navigating around the software to familiarize myself with it, but now I am a CorelVideo Studio fan and this time I will make sure to safeguard my serial # in case I have to reinstall later.Once you familiarize yourself with how to use the software, then it becomes easy, just like any other skill in life. I am still very relieved that they kept the layout basically the same, obviously with updated options, because I was dreading having to learn a new interface.I first used Corel almost 10 years ago to complete a project in college. I volunteered to do a video presentation within a group and once we got the footage and it came time to edit i said no problem, i will do it. Well, i didn't realize the depth of what it takes to edit a video, especially for someone technically challenged like me, Lol. But I spent a few hours navigating the software and watching support videos if needed and those few hours opened up my mind to all the possibilities of editing. I also had a newfound respect for video editors having an insight into what they do. After that college experience, I continued to use Corel to make home family videos more interesting and funny.","R2P8XGLP8Y4PXX",,,,,,,,,,,"6 people found this helpful","CorelVideo Studio Ultimate Fan!!!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P8XGLP8Y4PXX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BW15GWB5","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AHZBKZSSGT5WETR5ZNB6AE6JSBPA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZBKZSSGT5WETR5ZNB6AE6JSBPA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Platform For Display: PC Download, Edition: Ultimate","B0BW15GWB5","Platform For Display","PC Download","Edition","Ultimate",,

Selection, splice and delete operations are horribly slow, I quickly learned to wait a couple of seconds for an operation to complete to avoid accidently doing a second delete.The multi-camera editor is almost unusable, it loses track of the input files and then won't preview them even when they appear in the camera list. It randomly sets a start offset for clips and moves them around for no obvious reason.There doesn't appear to be any consistency about where project, capture and various other files get stored. I just want to be able to set one root folder and have all my projects and capture files organized below it but it seems that files are getting put all over the place.

Great value and quality—highly recommend for anyone who does home projects or crafting.","RJGJQDH0ODT0J",,,,,,,,,,,,"Strong, Natural, and So Versatile!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJGJQDH0ODT0J/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F1N8JZM5","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEP7H2YLFNHVRZSW2FHVISSX6MTQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEP7H2YLFNHVRZSW2FHVISSX6MTQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: ( 2mm * 800 Feet ) / Pc, Size: 2 Pcs","B0F1N8JZM5","Color","( 2mm * 800 Feet ) / Pc","Size","2 Pcs",,

Overall, I’m happy with it, but there are a few things worth noting if you’re coming from the previous model.First, the video quality during the day doesn’t seem drastically improved l. It’s good, just not a big leap. However, the night video is noticeably better. Much clearer and brighter, which makes a big difference for late-night deliveries or just general peace of mind.One thing I really appreciated is that the app connects to live view much faster now. I’m not sure if that’s thanks to the new doorbell itself or the newer sync module, but the lag I used to experience is basically gone. Big win there.Audio has also improved, the robotic echo that plagued the previous model is not that bad now. Conversations are clearer and more natural, which is great for talking to delivery drivers or guests.Now, about the field of view - yes, it’s a bit wider, but that comes with more distortion around the edges. I installed mine in a narrow hallway, so the wider angle isn’t really useful for me and the distortion is kind of distracting. But if you’re placing it in an open area and want to capture more, you’ll probably see that as a positive.Another drawback is the absence of dual-band WiFi, which is somewhat disappointing given that some competitors have supported 5 GHz WiFi for quite some time.In short, this is a solid upgrade, especially for night vision, audio, and connection speed. Just be aware of the trade-offs if you’re in a tighter space like I am.","R28TAYJ3X6PMWA",,,,,,,,,,,"65 people found this helpful","Solid upgrade, especially at night","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28TAYJ3X6PMWA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGQVYW2K","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFE2URMFPWUQ4SW3JBVNCNEY257Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFE2URMFPWUQ4SW3JBVNCNEY257Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Black, Style: System (Doorbell + Sync Module), Configuration: Doorbell","B0DGQVYW2K","Color","Black","Style","System (Doorbell + Sync Module)","Configuration","Doorbell"

(ie. how much water to add).I found the instruction manual to be very wordy. I think more illustrations would have been beneficial.I must say that one of the best features of this sprayer is the ability to adjust the flow rate. There is a dial at rear of the trigger that allows for this.  Cleaning the sprayer was not as simple as rinsing it off. Per the instructions, I concocted a mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol. This made the cleanup a smoother process.Customer service is via an email address which is not my preferred method for support. I did not verify how long it would take to receive a response but the seller indicates 18 hours.  I do think the bottle that holds the paint could be a bit larger so that I don't refill as often but that being said, I was happy with the sprayer , its capabilities and the fact that it allowed for multiple spray patterns.","R18DDPS3KDWH3G",,,,,,,,,,,"16 people found this helpful","Excellent Sprayer with multiple Spray Options!!!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18DDPS3KDWH3G/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F4X4RRWM","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AF4GBX37DOZ5KP3EBK6F7KP5BRMA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF4GBX37DOZ5KP3EBK6F7KP5BRMA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F4X4RRWM",,,,,,

The one with steel bristles had ripped my shoes apart and cut my skin when I stupidly used my foot as support while cleaning grill. This stainless mesh roller looked safe and I hoped it could also clean well. We use our oven and hot-air grill every day but don't clean daily and grates get quiet mucky. The grease and stains seem to bake on real hard and are difficult to clean. The cleaning roller did a better job than expected. It has a lot of power and it cleaned our oven grate and hot-air grill rack real well without too much effort. I used a bowl with some warm water and detergent and was amazed to see how well the roller removed the grit. It got stained as it removed the grit but then basically cleaned itself while keeping turning in the warm water. It also retained a bit of the water and cleaner foam on the roller that I could then nicely use to continue cleaning. I also noticed that on tough stains, instead of holding it down harder I 'bounced' it on/off the grill and that repeated impact took care of some very old, resilient stains. Running it both ways, along and against the wire rods also worked well. Unit is a strong quality and the bright light is a really nice feature, shows where to clean.

Then I disconnected, turned it on, and saw that it was fully charged.3) But! I ran it ~60s, it went from 100% to 25%. Not enough time to clean any grill.4) There is no way this is spinning 350 RPM, i.e. ~6 per second.5) Tried for 10s on a small section of my grill, couldn't clean anything. It couldn't even take away a few burnt crumbs that were on my stainless still grates after I had already cleaned them last tim. In their video where it leaves a shiny grill behind as you go must have been either edited or the grill must have been just dusted with some black dust.6) If you apply pressure, then it slows down to a point it cannot physically clean. If you hold it loose, then the chain acts like a wheel, the whole thing just travels along the grate, therefore no rubbing action. You need to hold it down with just enough pressure to have it scrub the grate without slowing down and without travelling along.I was hopeful, but man, such a #fail... :(","R1VC5ZKTNOH24H",,,,,,,,,,,"50 people found this helpful","Fails on all fronts, from charging to cleaning","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VC5ZKTNOH24H/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DX7FZ3Q8","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFQ3TFLKGJZQUDQMUEMFJ43OKA6Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQ3TFLKGJZQUDQMUEMFJ43OKA6Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DX7FZ3Q8",,,,,,

I’ve used Giddy Up three times and this is my candid assessment.If you are one who always brushes down your grill following grilling,  Giddy Up is a reasonable alternativeto a manual wire brush. If you tend to not clean your grill for days following grilling, Giddy Up is not a good device.Battery life seems to be good, but the device is underpowered. Even on a fairly clean grate, Giddy Up would bind up while going up and down the grate lengthwise.  I discovered operating Giddy Up perpendicular to the grate improved cleaning greatly, and even with reasonable pressure, the motor continued to turn without binding.I will keep this product because since I keep my grill clean, begin under powered is not that big a deal and I don’t have to worry about wire from my brush sticking on the grat3 and transferring to the food.This product is unfortunately over priced and under powered for most weekend grillers.","R2U401ER4IR31S",,,,,,,,,,,"27 people found this helpful","Great concept, but under powered for most people and overpriced","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U401ER4IR31S/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DX7FZ3Q8","Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHS3377UO2VVSJ4GRBN4OELG2QXQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHS3377UO2VVSJ4GRBN4OELG2QXQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DX7FZ3Q8",,,,,,

    These are very nice solar lights at a great price. They feel and look well made, quality. Only time will tell.how they hold up outside. They are bigger than expected, in a good way. I always read the measurments but often feel like things I buy are smaller or larger than expected lol. These came packaged well in a good box and properly written manual inside, even though you don't really need it. Just turn the switch to ""on"" and leave them in sun all day to get a full proper charge before their first night. They can be placed on a flat surface or hung from built-in metal folding handle on top. They even come with springloaded clips thst can be attached to handle to clip to something like a thin branch or such. The clips are small, the size of alligator clips approx, but clamp strongly. The light is proper brightness, not too bright, and a warm waxy yellow glow with gently flickering. Pretty realistic. The construction feels like quality plastic with crystal clear plastic lens, so safe for outdoors near pets etc in case one fell over, no glass to worry about. I liked them so much I promptly bought another set! And from the looks over many other reviews I see I'm not alone, lots of buyers bought more! There is a good size solar panel on top, so it looks like these will capture lots of light for getting a good charge. I could totally see these used indoors on a table or such after being charged outside, that's how nice they look. I really don't think you will be disappointed by buying these, so get some!

Plus, if you put all the tracks from the 60 CD box on the wall and threw a dart with your eyes closed, it would land on many other worthy tracks that could be on this 27 tracks  set.But what is here is a decent/good example of the band over its 60 years of shows.  Many Dead fans could not afford the high price of the larger box so this will be a taste of the unreleased shows over the decades.  And as with  most compilations everyone will wish certain songs were included and others deleted.  I also have the 60 CD box which I luckily received before the release date, so listening to this 3 CD set I know how hard it was to choose what's on this smaller sample.  The weight of this  sampler of goodies leans toward the '70s, '80s, and '90s.  There's one track from '69 and a few from the early '70's.And don't forget these tunes  are from unreleased live shows.  The sound is up to the usual standards of other live Dead releases.  The remastering is by Jeffrey Norman and David Glassner. Tape restoration and speed correction done by Jamie Howarth.  The discs slip into full pockets inside the four-fold cardboard packaging, plus a pocket for the  booklet which gives a short synopsis of each tune.  Plus I think the cover graphic is pretty cool.This is worth adding to your shelf of  live Dead just to  have more unreleased live Dead.  If I couldn't obtain the big box I would  certainly add this to my bulging Dead shelf of music.","R3UG1X9OUKG29Z",,,,,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","""THE RESULT OF DECADES ON THE ROAD.""  60 YEARS OF LIVE DEAD.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UG1X9OUKG29Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F16D32K4","Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFCDLFIAGKRTPRBLVBWM62IAZ72Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCDLFIAGKRTPRBLVBWM62IAZ72Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F16D32K4",,,,,,

This is not a chargeable device.  The switch is only a few inches away from the base which makes it convenient and easier to locate in a dark room. The power is just on/off: there is no dimming capability. The light is a warm yellow glow enough to read by if on a nightstand.I ordered this lamp to replace a previous one i keep in the bathroom. I like having a smaller lamp for late night or when guests visit so that there is not so harsh lights in the room.Any room in the house would be suitable for this lamp and it will complement or blend in with most decor.There is some assembly needed for 4 basic parts: the base, the lamp shade, a collar to clamp the shade in place to the base and a small appliance sized light bulb.

I purchased the digital HOME PREMIERE copy of Asteroid City, and the transaction was acceptable.Spoilers below...*****************Summary:  Movie about a writer, and his play.  The play has characters that develop on-the-fly with the writers imagination (Conrad Earp).  Clues are left throughout the movie to help you understand the development of each character.  Wes Anderson smacks you in the face over and over by letting you know nothing you're seeing is real (or finished), but you still get attached.  For instance, when you see an awkward Woodrow explain what his mother ""was like"" (to fellow stargazers) by making a 5-move-combo (instantly), unzipping a pristine photo of his (now dead) mother, your heart drops.  Then, the next line which is Wes, ""When did you lose her?  Officially this morning"".  A summary can't unpack this movie.  It's just great art from a Master.Quote: ""Are you married?  Of course."" (During Mexican Standoff)Scene: The scene where we learn how Augie's character was casted by Conrad.  The playwright and the player.Gem:  When Clifford (Aristou Meehan) learns in real time about his character needing to be dared to exist, (waiting to be dared to climb a cactus). Conrad is developing Clifford and the audience is in on it.  (These gems are all throughout the movie)Other:  Jeff Goldblum will win a Oscar for this.  Period.I love Wes Anderson.  I watch his movies every week for inspiration.  I have no doubt I've logged over 1,000 hours of his work (humble brag). Asteroid City will allow me the great fortune of countless hours, to play in a very abstract time-and-space, adoring the creation of storytelling and the characters that occupy that space.","R2KOU5WV4PO7QH",,,,,,,,,,,"29 people found this helpful","Juggernaut storytelling (and the process)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KOU5WV4PO7QH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C7SQVND8","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023",,,"amzn1.account.AEPX7XPKKNAYFDC56REE7ENPZWOA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPX7XPKKNAYFDC56REE7ENPZWOA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0C7SQVND8",,,,,,

There are three levels: (1) the television narrator, (2) the writer, director, actors, and (3) the play.  The movie is about the interaction of the levels. Yes, it's confusing. Sometimes it is hard to know which level we are in, though Scarlett Johansson is helpfully a blond as an actress and a brunette in the play. The lives of the actors seem to have no connection to the characters they play. The actors question the motivations for the events in the play: Jason Schwartzman complains to the ""director"" that he does not understand his character--and he is told that that is how he should play the character.  The viewer cannot help sympathizing with Schwartzman because nothing really makes much sense here.  Schwartzman is travelling with his four children who have not discovered that their mother has died.  Her ashes are in one of their tuperware containers. At first it seems that they have arrived in Asteroid City accidentally when their car breaks down, but then it seems to have been their destination. There is an awards ceremony for talented, accomplished kids. It is interrupted by an alien who snatches the town's asteroid--only to return it later are ""inventoried it""--whatever that means. So, the film seems to be about various forms of loss.  That's the way I understand its various disparate scenes to come together.  Thus, Johansson as an actress runs away from the play, while her character in the play, a famous actress, contemplates suicide, in despair, it seems over lost lovers.  Meanwhile, she carries on a relationship with Schwartzman (his character in the play is ""Augie Steen"", though he seems to have no connection with St. Augustine.) by looking through the windows of adjacent motel cabins.  A teacher leading class tour of Asteroid City is constantly counting her students, afraid she might lose one.  All the visitors are quarantined so that word will not get out about the alien--and they seem to experience loss of their individual identities. The actors do not know who they are because they always take on other people's roles, the characters in the play are stuck in roles that they are assigned even if they cannot understand them, and the audience looks to the theater and the actors to reveal truths that neither has. Children lose their identity when they lose their parents, adults when they lose their lovers. Finally, the playwright dies six months into the play's run.  There are probably more kinds of loss that I am missing. If all this sounds good, don't get your hopes up. The film is fine to think about, just tortuous to watch. Anderson's brand of stylized acting worked well in The Grand Budapest Hotel because the Stefan Zweig story on which it is based is so emotional. But this kind of acting is really out of place in Asteroid City because none of the characters has any real emotions. It is impossible to connect with them or to care.  The movie isn't a story so much as disconnected events--somehow intent on showing that it itself has also lost its identity. You can reflect on that if you want. It's just not a good premise for a film.","R1WJ2ISPBXZC48",,,,,,,,,,,"14 people found this helpful","Interesting idea—tortuous to watch","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WJ2ISPBXZC48/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C7SQVND8","Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AHGWCVRADDTC4JJ4BKGDU5TKTOZQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGWCVRADDTC4JJ4BKGDU5TKTOZQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0C7SQVND8",,,,,,

Tom Hanks (einer meiner Lieblingsschauspieler) ist einer der Darsteller, also hoffte ich auf eine Komödie. Noch dazu mit diesem wahren Aufgebot von Weltklasseschauspielern! Und die Rezensionen hier haben sich  auch mehrheitlich vor Begeisterung überschlagen.Doch, ehrlich, ich verstehe diesen Film nicht! Überhaupt nicht!2x habe ich ihn mir jetzt angesehen … ich komme einfach nicht dahinter, was die Message sein soll. Ist es ein Film? Ist es ein Kammerschauspiel? Man mag mich jetzt als Kunstbanause schimpfen … der Sinn und Zweck des Filmes entzieht sich mir. Ist es ein Blick durch‘s Schlüsselloch, wie es bei Rollencastings zugeht? Hinter den Kulissen einer Filmproduktion? Gegliedert ist das Movie in Sequenzen, wie ein Regiescript oder Szenenbuch. Ein Moderator verbindet die filmischen Puzzleteile. Wie gesagt: ich verstehe das Ganze nicht - und irgendwie bin ich unbefriedigt.Keine Spannung in der Handlung….es dudelt so unaufgeregt vor sich hin. Die Schauspieler sagen ihren Text ohne irgend spürbarer Dramaturgie oder Gesichtsmimik. Sehr spartanisch. Und, keine Spur von Happyend oder dem dramatischen Schlußknall. Die Akteure steigen am Ende in ihre Autos und verlassen den Ort „Astroid-City“, der mitten in der Wüste, am Ende der Welt,  zu liegen scheint. Und da fühle ich mich jetzt auch allein gelassen mit meinem Sinieren! Mitten im Nirgendwo.Ich habe schon einige seiner Filme gesehen. Die fand ich eigentlich immer originell, manchmal skurril. Sollte dieser Film ein Beispiel dessen sein, was uns Zuschauern blüht, sollte die „Künstliche  Intelligenz“ die Materie „Schauspiel“ übernehmen?

Hauptdarsteller Jason Schwartzman sagt es kurz vor Ende des Films selbst,, Ich verstehe das Stück immernoch nicht,,Ich glaube nicht das der Text ihne Grund so platziert wurde.Mein empfinden war nach rund 20 Minuten auszumachen. Aber ich war mehr neugierig als enttäuscht.Was absolut für den Film spricht, und jetzt lasse Ich mal den Film Nostalgiker raus , ist diese Farbenfrohe Bildgewalt. Diese kräftigen Farben gibt es seit den 50er/60er Jahren nicht mehr. Aber genau diese Farbgebung und art Filme zu drehen , hat den Filmen damals diesen unverwechselbaren und ganz eigenen Charme verliehen. Das , was Ich an diesen alten Filmen so liebe.Das andere was für den Film spricht ist natürlich diese unglaubliche Starbesetzung.Scarlett Johansson ist einfach immer klasse. Kann alles spielen und sieht einfach immer umwerfend aus.Und die alten Hasen wie Hanks,Dafoe,Norton,Cranston,Swinton, Dillon geben noch Ihre ganz eigene Note , aber auch Erfahrung mit hinein.Kleiner Brüller ( sonst fand Ich den Film eher Mau was Lacher anging ) der tanzende Roadrunner im Abspann.Und nochmal zum ,, nicht verstehen,, …. Ich glaube manche Filme muss man oder soll man einfach nicht verstehen. So bleiben Sie aber im Gedächtnis.Mir persönlich kam der Film vor wie ein Mix aus dem eigentlichen Film und dem Casting bzw. einem Making of.Also auf diese Weise dann doch irgendwie genial gedacht und brilliant gemacht. Ich denke der Film braucht eine Weile bis er im Gehirn alle Gedankengänge durch hat.Für Leute die einfach mal nur einen Film genießen und abschalten wollen ( wie mich halt ) ist der Film eher schwierig. Wie gesagt, der brauch ne Weile bis er verarbeitet ist bei mir.","R33N0OOBTTW5HE",,,,,,,,,,,,"Keine Ahnung …..",,"Reviewed in Germany on October 25, 2023",,,,,"","B0C7SQVND8",,,,,,

Pop music often celebrates or affirms a culture's predominant values and ideals. Rock n' roll embraced its own distracted, alternate ethos, which often resulted more in escapism and hero worship than in any meaningful scrutiny of reality. By stark contrast, The Talking Heads somehow made music that feels and plays like a distorted critical mirror onto their own society. Multi-layered, often highly hip-swinging rhythms, combined with sounds and effects approaching psychedelia provide enough ear candy to deflect the nearly deviant themes of the often twisted lyrics. As such, Talking Heads managed to provide a critical lens onto modern life and popular culture while simultaneously embedding themselves within it. Few have managed to inject so much intellectualism and artistic sensibility into pop music while keeping sales at reasonable levels of self-preservation.The band's second album, ""More Songs About Buildings and Food,"" sounds so refreshing, unique and singular that it seems like another debut. Their first album, ""77,"" sounds musically light years away from the follow-up's thick arrangements and electronically laden atmosphere. Many bands require multiple releases to fully gestate, but Talking Heads miraculously attained it after a single album. Like an infant blue whale, they grew up fast and never sounded the same again. The 1977 version of ""Stay Hungry,"" a bonus track included with the album's 2006 re-release, when juxtaposed with the version included on ""Buildings and Food,"" demonstrates this astonishing transition.Though the music exploded with a new frenetic inventiveness, the lyrics continued their skewed, confused look at human life in an increasingly technological civilization. One obvious standout track in this regard, ""The Big Country,"" fully rejects this growing mass culture with an anthropological literal bird's eye view. From the window of an airplane, the song's narrator looks down on the fields, towns and people, who scurry ant and flea-like between their established institutions and expectations. Though the narrator admits that such a life has some advantages, the song's chorus chimes the harsh conclusion: ""I wouldn't live there if you paid me."" Paradoxically, one does need to get paid, sometimes heavily, to afford the lifestyle in question. Regardless, the song masterfully lays the average American life starkly bare. Though it doesn't present solutions - a song can only do so much - it does present the often automatic suburban lifestyle as a question rather than an inevitable fate.Other songs also question deep societal norms. The jolting ""I'm Not In Love"" outright claims that we don't need love and that ""I believe someday we'll live in a world without love."" Equal to the seemingly deterministic suburban lifestyle, the emotion and value most treasured by that same lifestyle comes under scrutiny as potentially unnecessary. Were such an idea presented in a less musically seductive manner, the devotees of passion may cry heresy. Though one could easily see the song as a simple denial following a failed relationship, the lyrics' scope suggest a wider range of scrutiny.""With Our Love"" remains painfully relevant today. As many know, the combination of work and love doesn't mix well chemically or socially. The song's repeated cries of ""I have to get to work now... set an example for us!"" while elastic guitar riffs oscillate in unison heightens these familiar tensions to fever pitch. Modern angst pours from this song and many others on the album. ""Warning Sign"" needs little explanation following the opening lyric, ""warning sign, warning sign I hear it but I pay no mind."" ""The Girls Want to be with the Girls"" probably includes one of pop music's few lyrical instances of ""abstract analysis."" Is the song a celebration of supposed ""female values"" or an observation on gender tension? The sometimes vague words, like most good lyrics, leave room for multiple interpretations. ""Artists Only,"" with its wonderfully creepy instrumental refrain, probably satirizes the worst sort of art school student. Since the band formed while in art school, they probably had plenty of experience with people taking themselves too seriously (""pretty soon now, I will be bitter""). And of course the album begins with a frenetic horse gallop into an ecstasy of shaping another person to one's own designs and desires. ""Thank You For Sending Me an Angel"" seems to explore the psychological dimension of relationships that involves the desire of one person to ""improve upon"" the other, or at least the trap of seeing one's partner exclusively in light of one's own expectations and needs. The song launches the album off appropriately and the energy never ceases until the first nanosecond of silence following the closing song.""More Songs About Buildings And Food"" stands amongst the Talking Heads' best work and amongst some of the best rock/pop produced in the late 1970s. The influence of producer Brian Eno stands out saliently and he helped propel the band forwards into increasingly innovative territory. The entire album, even the minor hit, an Eno-treated cover version of Al Green's ""Take Me To The River,"" sounds amazingly fresh some thirty-six years later. Perhaps this is partly because the intervening years have seen an increasing commodification of pop music and a considerable de-emphasis on innovation and exploration. The bucks now seem to reign. Though the Talking Heads would eventually climb the popular charts in the 1980s, in 1978 their sales were by no means stellar. This remained true even up until their universally acclaimed album ""Remain in Light."" Would this important band have survived for so long in today's money music environment? Or would they have been relegated to Internet obscurity? Of course no one can say, but we can remain happy that these musically curious art students decided to take a different course in life and that they happened to live in a time that welcomed, or at least allowed, their askew questioning and angular perspectives. And 1978 was only the beginning, or maybe the second beginning?","RI6QZZY1V1RQM",,,,,,,,,,,"17 people found this helpful","More songs about the bizarre and confusing modern world...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI6QZZY1V1RQM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0FB3Y7QHR","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2014",,,"amzn1.account.AGP7UZVT6IJ5A7IXB63GQKY64BZQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGP7UZVT6IJ5A7IXB63GQKY64BZQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0FB3Y7QHR",,,,,,

I feel that once Eno was on board, TH proceeded to do their best work. Warning Sign, Found a Job, Thank You For, I'm Not in Love, and Take Me to the River are some of my favorite songs by the group. Girls Just Want to be With, Artists Only, and With Our Love not so much. I'm still trying to discover the hidden intricacies of a song like The Big Country, which I am endlessly fascinated with. With it's faux-country sound, laid back ease, and lyrics about the decline of America's beauty through shopping malls, highways, and hamburger stands, it might be the secret hinge on which the entire history of TH, as well as the music of their time, turns. David Byrne rarely ever wrote a better song. Is it possible to imagine Dylan and the Band recording this back at Big Pink as an alternate slice of quirky Americana? Perhaps.If you like this album, ( and what's to say you won't?) then you would do well to get everything else that TH ever did, up to Stop Making Sense. After that, it's all downhill with Little Creatures, True Stories, and Naked. Unless you're a fan of David Byrne's solo work, in which case you should just get EVERYTHING by TH. But this album is essential, of course. Recommended big time.-------------------------PEACE","R1OSNU5YQLOP3H",,,,,,,,,,,"10 people found this helpful","An alternate slice of quirky Americana?

There's also a ultra-cool cover of Al Green's, ""Take Me To The River"". Brian Eno co-produced this album with the band. The results are stellar and timeless. Nothing on this records sounds dated. The music still sounds fresh and innovative especially on the classic, ""Found A Job"". Anyone who doesn't love that song must be crazy! The killer outro is legendary. I really like ""Thank You For Sending Me An Angel"" and ""The Good Thing"". Definitely 2 of the Talking Heads' most accomplished and beloved songs. ""With Our Love"" is also a standout. So fun and quirky. There really isn't one bad song in the bunch. Every track has so many layers and tempo changes. Nothing is stale or repetitive. ""The Girls Want to Be With The Girls"" and ""I'm Not In Love"" are mini-masterpieces. And finally, ""Artists Only"" is pure avant-garde.

I can safely say it changed my life as it inspired me to form a band a become a musician. It's difficult to describe how unique they sounded in the late 70s, when it was all Les Pauls turned up to 11. The only band to compare with them were probably XTC (who they actually toured with).Tina Weymouth always seems to come in for some slightly sexist flak, but her bass was the propulsion behind the whole unit. When they go off into the funky workout at the end of 'Found A Job', I'd defy anybody to keep still.With the benefit of hindsight, I can see that the scratchy Fenders and driving basslines were their weird, angular take on Memphis soul - a kind of black music for very white people. I still regard it as the quintessential Heads album, with the original four-piece firing on all cylinders and aided by the perfect choice of producer. They may have pushed the envelope a little more on subsequent albums but I love this collection of disciplined, grooving pop songs.Buy it, kids, and be as inspired as I was.","R2L7H5I9JLTMKH",,,,,,,,,,,,"Their best album for me",,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 16, 2008",,,,,"","B0FB3Y7QHR",,,,,,

If you're on the fence about adding lighting to your outdoor area, let me save you some time—these are the lights you want.Effortless InstallationThe first thing that stood out to me was how easy they were to install. The lights come with adjustable base inserts, so they fit 4x4, 5x5, or 6x6 vinyl and wooden posts. I used them on a combination of wood and vinyl posts in my backyard, and they snapped in snugly with no additional tools or drilling required. The secure fit gives peace of mind that they won’t blow off or shift.Reliable Solar ChargingEach light charges through the day and turns on automatically at dusk. Even after a few overcast days, they still held a charge and stayed on throughout the night. I was genuinely impressed by how efficient the solar panels are—no wiring, no hassle, and no increase in my energy bill.Beautiful Dual-Color LightingOne of the best features is the switchable lighting option between warm white and cool white. The warm white creates a cozy, inviting glow—perfect for evenings spent outside with family or entertaining guests. The cool white is brighter and more modern, great for extra visibility and security. It’s nice to have both options depending on the mood or occasion.Durable & WeatherproofThese lights are truly built to withstand the elements. We’ve had everything from heavy rain to strong winds, and they haven’t skipped a beat. The IP44 waterproof rating holds up well, and the high-quality black plastic housing still looks brand new weeks later. There’s no fading, cracking, or water damage—something I’ve had issues with on cheaper lights.Sleek, Stylish LookAesthetically, they’re a huge upgrade to my fence and deck area. The sleek black finish blends well with any decor style—modern, rustic, or classic—and gives my property a more polished, high-end feel. I’ve gotten multiple compliments from neighbors who want to know where I got them.Safe and PracticalBeyond looks, they also serve a functional purpose. The soft illumination makes it easy to navigate walkways and steps at night, reducing the risk of tripping or stumbling in the dark. They’re perfect for patios, porches, gardens, or even driveways.Final VerdictThis 12-pack of solar post cap lights is one of the best outdoor purchases I’ve made in a long time. Affordable, attractive, durable, and energy-efficient—what more could you ask for? Whether you’re upgrading your home’s curb appeal or just want better visibility in your yard, you won’t regret investing in these.Highly recommend to anyone looking to elevate their outdoor space with minimal effort and maximum impact!","R2AIMZYPVG1GVW","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-b+4dCQaL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UGWXC2jUL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IR0YVMZIL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DivJcgEXL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mlkI4ZDPL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"Game-Changer for My Outdoor Space – Stylish, Functional, and Built to Last!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AIMZYPVG1GVW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DZBSFPSD","Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHM3PCY2W23ZMNMEXIJAQRCI4XGQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHM3PCY2W23ZMNMEXIJAQRCI4XGQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 12 Pack","B0DZBSFPSD","Size","12 Pack",,,,

I’m also impressed with the duration of the charge with these lights.  Some of our other solar applications will only stay lit for a few hours after dark while these lights make it through the night and seem to turn off only with the rising sun. These solar light caps are a stately black  design with 2 switch lighting capacity. You could choose cold light or warm white which is on the underside of the light. The brighter light may be considered for more visibility and safety while the warm white setting can offer more of a romantic glow. I loved the warm white setting. Overall as the women of the household..this product was easily installed, an upgrade to my outdoor living space and having 12 lights the price was right.

How could  such a simple thing like this make all the difference in the world for someone with arthritic hands like me?

I couldn't crochet like I used to.  Things took me forever to do!  So frustrating!  To say  I am TOTALLY amazed with this product is an understatement.  Every stitch has PERFECT tension.  I never had to do a stitch over again.  I crocheted for a solid 2 hours and my hand did not cramp.... nothing!  You don't have to wrap any yarn around your forefinger and hold your finger straight out  for hours.  That's all  gone.  The ring does everything for you.  I was even able to make the yarn magic right  with this on my  finger.  It did not get in the  way.  It's bendable so you can make it  bigger  or smaller if you like.  It came in the most adorable tiny red box with a bow.  I felt that the person sending it really cared about their wonderful item.  And it also looks nice on your finger like an artsy ring.  I'm going back to crochet some more now.  Can hardly wait.  If you are  skeptical like I was, try it like I did.  I'm so glad I did.  I can't say enough good things about it.

Once mounted, you can then mount the thermostat.  You will be able to slightly see the white mounting screws from the side. No big deal.

See pictures.I had to get real creative with some self tapping screws in order to make my trim kit work.  I had to drill through the plastic because as you can see the screw holes from the thermostat wire kit do not line up with the screw holes on the trim kit.  This is the most basic of things and they managed to mess it up.  Only the bottom one matches…But that isn’t even the worst part.  Even if you don’t use the side screw hole (which again don’t line up) and just use the bottom one only, the thermostat doesn’t sit flush in the trim kit.  It does not make a full connection and sits way too high and “tilted” off of the trim plate.  Because the pins never get fully set, the thermostat will not turn receive power.So my solution to this, because I NEED a trim plate, was to lower the wiring piece just slightly and drill some self tapping screws into the left and right screw holes THROUGH the trim plate plastic.  Now the wiring piece isn’t flush, and my thermostat isn’t flush in the trim kit.  But it is connect and working now.The ecobee thermostats are great, don’t let this review knock them.  They just need to fix their trim plate because it doesn’t work.  What should have taken less than 5 minutes took me almost half an hour to figure out.","R2XIFDD90TNBCN","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61U32Db2+dL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wgrqrGUgL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61s3yH3JIIL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717fI3zChvL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZFcwNJBwL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","PLEASE READ:  Does not fit ecobee stats….

Sound quality is excellent — crisp highs, deep bass, and very little surface noise right out of the sleeve. Musically, this feels like Gaga getting back to her theatrical, fearless roots. There’s a mix of synth-pop, glam rock, and dark disco that somehow works together beautifully. Standout tracks for me were “Abracadabra” and “Venus Reborn.” If you’re a fan of The Fame Monster and Chromatica, this feels like a fusion of both with a little extra edge. A must-have for collectors and longtime fans.","RVWTB8AUBWZZS",,,,,,,,,,,"3 people found this helpful","Stunning Pressing and a Bold Return to Form","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVWTB8AUBWZZS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DV8TG6N9","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEF56MCFQZ75NJVSCBYFLKNK7YCA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEF56MCFQZ75NJVSCBYFLKNK7YCA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DV8TG6N9",,,,,,

I also like that it has a four-digit combination, which I consider the minimum for any type of keyless lock.The size is substantial enough, while the shackle is not too thick to work on many locker handles. The combination dial is easily accessible and works smoothly. For the money, it gets the (basic) job done.I have to point out that, while this is a metal lock and reasonably well-built, it is not to be considered a high-security lock. It is designed, as the saying goes, to keep honest people out. It would not stand up to a determined effort to remove it. Moreover, I really don't think it would be very durable in an outdoor environment, despite its being billed as ""waterproof."" If it is used outdoors, frequent lubrication would be essential.That said, for most casual uses – such as gym lockers – it is ideal. And attractive. She already has received a number of compliments on it.Updates: I will update this review if my future experience with this product warrants any revision of my review and/or rating.","R2CV0NGFVA6PNU",,,,,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","Cute lock for gym locker","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CV0NGFVA6PNU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DZ2HH1L4","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AG7U64PY52JTZPIPCUS4IQZCIHUQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG7U64PY52JTZPIPCUS4IQZCIHUQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Item Package Quantity: 1, Color: Basic Rose Pink","B0DZ2HH1L4","Item Package Quantity","1","Color","Basic Rose Pink",,

Originally, French director Adrien Maben had an idea to film ""The Floyd"" (as they were referred to back in the day) in front of classical paintings. The band rejected the idea. After quite a bit of time had passed and the director and the band had still not managed to meet, he went on holiday to Pompeii with his wife. Sometime during his walks around the ruins, he lost his passport. Returning there in the evening to search for it, he found himself inspired by the stillness of the ruins and its atmosphere. Thus was born an idea. Contacting The Floyd again, he proposed that he film them live amongst the ruins in the Roman Ampiheater of Pompeii. They liked the idea and agreed. One of the city council memebers was a Floyd fan in Pompeii, and he convinced the city's elders to do the unprecedented: Allow a rock band to perform and record amongst the ruins of the ancient city. No one would be allowed to do so again for 45 years until, David Gilmore, by then a legend, came back and performed an actual concert in Pompeii at the same site in 2016. This is also available on Blu Ray, BTW .Despite his initial good fortune, Maben's troubles began.  Maben soon discovered that the cables he had run out to the Ampitheater where gladiators once battled were inadequate for the massive power supplies needed, and ultimately he had to run a massive cable all the way back to the city of modern Pompeii with persons posted to guard it. His one week of filming was now down to 3 or 4 days. Still, he wanted to create an ""anti-Woodstock."" The trend had been to record a band live with the audience becoming another member. In THIS case, Pink Floyd would be performing only to the crew, and we viewers would be their audience--along with a few children who managed to sneak in (one of my friends' cousins in Vico Equense recounted how he snuck in with his friends.) Even in early October, the band perfomed under the burning sun, resorting to even filming some night time shots perhaps because the ampitheater was so much cooler. It also made for some very creative use of lighting to have Waters and Gimour appear and disapppear. Track shots and varius techniques showed the band walking along Veusvius (and Etna?) and when the film was intitally shown, despite good reviews Adrien Maben decided it was a bit too short. He also filmed the band doing some more performances in Paris and rehearsing back in Abbey Road Studies, where they would work for the next year experimenting and recording what would become thier number one album, THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON--selling over 50 million copies, and staying on the billboard top 200 for 741 weeks- over 14 years. This second release in 1974 would become the definitve theatrical Pompeii film. For years growing up, I would go over to friend's parties. In those darkened parent’s living rooms we would hang our with our girl friends and watch this film on low res VHS tapes. The audio often wouldn't track well. Eventually I would pick up my own ""HI FI"" stereo copy of the film -that was still new technology. Later,I would snag a much better looking release on Laserdisc in my quest for the perfect copy. Finally, in the early 2000's the film was released on DVD. Alas it was a new, ""Director's Cut."" Usually, I prefer these cuts in movies, but in this case it was far inferior, and picture quality is middling. Maben added video game-like computer graphics, very dated looking even for then,  cutting away from the band and distracting from the film. Additional inteviews that he shot in 16mm black and white were added, but they only served to slow down the film. Digging into the sub menus, one could find the first cut of the film- but it is only the performances. Interviews with Nick mason ordering breakfast, “I’ll have egg, sausage, chips and beans – and a tea,” and  seeking in vain a pie without the crust. Along with the band’s reminiscences, Waters arguing about over active imaginations hearing a sibilance on a second cut of Obscured by Clouds ( foreshadowing their later acrimonious  breakup), and some very stoned and funny commentary by Gilmour and Waters, the former assuring us that they are not a ""Drug-orientated group. Trust us"" while being very red-eyed and obviously stoned, had audiences laughing quite strongly. None of that was visible on the DVD as a fluid cut. One could also find an interview with driector Maben, which is unfotunately not available on this release. What is available is a MUCH sharper (Finally) higher resolution presentation, with the same cut much as I saw on VHS, Laserdic, and finally in IMAX at the theaters last week, which should please most buyers. Unfortunately, they did not make the film available in 4K UHD, I suspect beacause they think that demand might not warrant it, but this copy is the highest quality home release we Floyd fans have ever had. Acoustically, much as in the IMAX presentation, this cut is a revelation. The soundtracks are available in three flavors:  2.0 uncompressed LCPM: linear pulse coded Modulation, which is the highest possible quality for a two channel stereo presentation and probably close to how it was originally presented in the best theaters back in the 70's. You also have 5.1 Dolby True HD surround, and Dolby Atmos, in which if you have the right speaksers and set up sounds will seem to emanate from your ceilings as well as to be a totally emersive wrap around experience. I had my head cocked and turning behind me in the  theater as I could hear Richard Wright and Dave Mason's separate voicies behind me, as well as sound swirling around the theater. The famed Steve Wilson has done an amazing job remixing and cleaning up these old recordings, which sound like today's best reference grade audio; that’s no small achievement for a 53 year old film. Subtitles are available in German, Italian, Spanish, and others- but no English, and they are limited to speech and not whilst singing, as is typical of most concert discs, unfortunately. The film is both surprising, at times humorous, and strangely meserizing, with Maben's tracking shots around drummer Nick Mason, and other cuts of the band bringing us into a near trance-like state. Images of frescos from ancient Pompeiian homes, and statues seem erie and fit in with shots of the city and the music, making for a unique experience. I would not throw out my old copy just for the additional interviews and Maben's commentary, but this is clearly the superior and only copy to have if you wish to see Pink Floyd in concert as they were intended to be seen. Online you can find an audio only recording of Nick Mason and Steven Wilson discussing the film after watching it with audience on its 2025 premiere. I’ve waited 40 years to see this properly released. Highly recommended.","R35NGOA4R8RE0A","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81x1Kl9o5JL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gsxQ0NXhL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FebKfDdvL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uUDJbnetL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"26 people found this helpful","FINALLY!

So/so picture and bland audio. Missing some content. This new release Blu-ray is phenomenal. Although the picture is 4:3 so it has black bars on the side the pic quality is stellar. I’m simply amazed how well detailed and clean it looks. 4K quality despite it being a 1080p Blu-ray. Note I played it on a 4k bdp to a solid 4K quantum dot tv. The sound quality is remarkable. Dolby Atmos or Dolby TrueHD or pcm all top notch. Exceptional clarity and separation & oomph yet smooth. Of course I’m happy the picture looks good but it’s the sound I’m most after and this remaster delivers. I don’t feel it needs any EQing. Quite frankly that likely would sabatoge the sound. I believe this how all the members wanted it to sound. This is the marquis PF line up as well. You will hear this in numerous other reviews: it’s a must have for Pink Floyd fans or those that simply appreciate quality music presented in an exceptional way. Price is right too so take advantage of that rarity for legit PF hard copies.I do not have “golden ears” and I’m not young but I know what I’m talking about.

You will see an amazing combination of 4 hell of musicians: Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals), and David Gilmour (guitar, vocals). The original vinyl album was produced about 6 years after Syd Barrett left the band. So here you will see the creativity virtuosity of 4 out of the hell musicians: Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals), and David Gilmour (guitar, vocals). I was born in 1964, so my adolescence was marked by this band (despite the bad taste “disco wave” that marked the late 1970s and most of the 1980s).I truly think this blu ray release is visually and musically astonishing. Essentially, you have two main choices here. One is to go directly to the (non-live) concert at the Pompeii Amphitheatre. Here you will be astonished by individual and group creative process leading to the vinyl release. Alternatively, you go the same plus several inserts showing material from interviews to all members of the band. These exchanges are interesting as the reflect differences in personality when it comes to how strong or well-founded provide opinions.Finally, but not least, the images are also astonishing when it comes to the historical Pompeii images.Should I mention a negative issue, it you are interested in the blu ray release exclusively, the package is a bit disappointing. You get a cardboard envelope that opens in two halves with the blu ray in one and a small 6-page booklet. So, no standard rigid blu ray case.","RAFAR0OM8H6RX",,,,,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","A great treat from a great time in history of (progressive) rock","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAFAR0OM8H6RX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DXWTL8WL","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGT2IXH57JBGCH2Z4STTX33KBVJQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGT2IXH57JBGCH2Z4STTX33KBVJQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DXWTL8WL",,,,,,

En octobre 1971, Pink Floyd a déjà 5 albums à son actif et a terminé « Meddle » qui sortira à la fin du mois, un de leurs chefs d’œuvre, sans doute leur premier. Toujours en quête d’innovation, le groupe demande au réalisateur Adrian Maben de les filmer lors d’un concert sans public dans les ruines de l’amphithéâtre de Pompéi. « Une sorte d’anti-Woodstock » selon les termes de Maben, une expérience comme l’appelle les membres du groupe, misant sur la qualité sonore obsessionnelle du groupe, plutôt que « les réactions du public ». Les prises de vues sont réalisées du 4 au 7 octobre. Puis de nouvelles sessions sont enregistrées du 13 au 20 décembre à Paris pour compléter le tournage de Pompéi qui a subi quelques problèmes techniques mais qui démontraient aussi que le groupe avait de l’humour et du second degré (« Mademoiselle Nobs », blague sympa enregistrée…avec une chienne !). Une version audio remasterisée existait déjà dans le coffret « The Early Years 1972 » en 2016 avec 5 titres et la version alternative de « Careful with that axe, Eugene ». Cet enregistrement est donc loin d’être une découverte. Mais 2025 est l’occasion d’avoir (enfin) une version remixée en audio (2 CD) et vidéo, et pas par n’importe qui car il s’agit de Steven Wilson, musicien passionnant mais aussi un excellent ingénieur du son toujours sur les bons coups, permettant de redécouvrir quelques-uns des groupes qui l’ont influencé et lui font confiance pour le meilleur rendu sonore possible (Pink Floyd bien sûr mais aussi King Crimson, Marillion, Yes, The Who, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull…). A chaque fois, il frappe fort. Ici le son de chaque instrument ressort fabuleusement, en particulier la batterie de Mason, aucune comparaison avec la version d’origine ou même celle de 2016, le remixage était utile. Il faut dire que le son stéréo du documentaire était juste correct.Ce « Live at Pompeii » représente vraiment une charnière dans la carrière de Pink Floyd. Pas encore devenu le mastodonte qu’il sera à peine 2-3 ans plus tard, le groupe joue encore dans un style post-psychédélique avec une approche toujours expérimentale mais commence à s’en éloigner pour aller ailleurs. « A saucerful of secrets » offre l’occasion à Gilmour de triturer sa guitare comme jamais, tandis que Wright martèle son piano, que Waters s’acharne sur le gong, et que Mason n’en finit plus de frapper ses fûts. Le final du morceau tire plus vers le prog’ presque symphonique, dans une apothéose entre les claviers de Wright et la voix de Gilmour. Ce dernier sait tout aussi bien chanter d’une voix puissante ou éthérée, que distiller une atmosphère mystérieuse comme dans le lancinant « Careful with That Axe, Eugene ». Ambiance planante que vient rompre Waters par son cri strident et toujours aussi terrifiant. Des morceaux qu’on trouvait déjà dans le disque live de « Ummagumma », et qui appartiennent donc à la « première période » du groupe. Mais on sent un changement, une mutation… Si « Atom heart mother » marquait déjà la transition entre les sixties et seventies, mettant fin en quelque sorte au versant le plus psychédélique et expérimental du groupe, cette fin d’année 1971 annonce clairement les grandes heures du Floyd. Quand il joue le morceau en ce début du mois d’octobre à Pompéi, le groupe n’a pas encore sorti « Meddle » où figure la version studio de « Echoes ». Il arrivera dans les bacs quelques semaines plus tard. C’est donc presqu’un « inédit », au moins pour l’équipe de tournage. Cependant, cette pièce épique était en gestation depuis plusieurs mois, et était déjà jouée en concert depuis quelques mois. D’abord appelée « Nothing » (« rien »), puis « The son of nothing » (« le fils de rien ») et enfin « The return of the son of nothing » (« le retour du fils de rien ») en forme de boutade, cette suite de plusieurs idées musicales trouve son aboutissement en une longue symphonie rock. Mais à la différence de « Atom heart mother », le morceau « Echoes » comporte une partie chantée, et se joue uniquement avec le groupe, sans apport extérieur d’orchestre ou de chorale. Une pièce sublime qui préfigure l’apogée de Pink Floyd dans les années 70, de « The Dark side of the moon » à « The wall ». Pour ceux et celles qui souhaitent découvrir ce concert unique, je conseille d’abord la version vidéo très prenante mais pour les fans cette version audio est fantastique. J’ai monté le son et le résultat est tout simplement impressionnant.","R130D2A33A929D",,,,,,,,,,,,"Le Floyd d’avant Dark Side of the Moon, sans filet et passionnant.",,"Reviewed in France on May 6, 2025",,,,,"","B0DXWTL8WL",,,,,,

La cura nella presentazione e la possibilità di possedere fisicamente un documento sonoro di un evento così leggendario aggiungono un fascino particolare a questo disco. È un modo per rivivere un momento storico della musica rock e per apprezzare l'arte di una band che ha saputo trascendere i generi.UN'IMMERSIONE NELLA LEGGENDAAnche per chi non ha familiarità con la performance originale, ascoltare questo disco può rappresentare un'occasione unica per immergersi nell'atmosfera di quel concerto straordinario.

Originally, French director Adrien Maben had an idea to film ""The Floyd"" (as they were referred to back in the day) in front of classical paintings. The band rejected the idea. After quite a bit of time had passed and the director and the band had still not managed to meet, he went on holiday to Pompeii with his wife. Sometime during his walks around the ruins, he lost his passport. Returning there in the evening to search for it, he found himself inspired by the stillness of the ruins and its atmosphere. Thus was born an idea. Contacting The Floyd again, he proposed that he film them live amongst the ruins in the Roman Ampiheater of Pompeii. They liked the idea and agreed. One of the city council memebers was a Floyd fan in Pompeii, and he convinced the city's elders to do the unprecedented: Allow a rock band to perform and record amongst the ruins of the ancient city. No one would be allowed to do so again for 45 years until, David Gilmore, by then a legend, came back and performed an actual concert in Pompeii at the same site in 2016. This is also available on Blu Ray, BTW .Despite his initial good fortune, Maben's troubles began.  Maben soon discovered that the cables he had run out to the Ampitheater where gladiators once battled were inadequate for the massive power supplies needed, and ultimately he had to run a massive cable all the way back to the city of modern Pompeii with persons posted to guard it. His one week of filming was now down to 3 or 4 days. Still, he wanted to create an ""anti-Woodstock."" The trend had been to record a band live with the audience becoming another member. In THIS case, Pink Floyd would be performing only to the crew, and we viewers would be their audience--along with a few children who managed to sneak in (one of my friends' cousins in Vico Equense recounted how he snuck in with his friends.) Even in early October, the band perfomed under the burning sun, resorting to even filming some night time shots perhaps because the ampitheater was so much cooler. It also made for some very creative use of lighting to have Waters and Gimour appear and disapppear. Track shots and varius techniques showed the band walking along Veusvius (and Etna?) and when the film was intitally shown, despite good reviews Adrien Maben decided it was a bit too short. He also filmed the band doing some more performances in Paris and rehearsing back in Abbey Road Studies, where they would work for the next year experimenting and recording what would become thier number one album, THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON--selling over 50 million copies, and staying on the billboard top 200 for 741 weeks- over 14 years. This second release in 1974 would become the definitve theatrical Pompeii film. For years growing up, I would go over to friend's parties. In those darkened parent’s living rooms we would hang our with our girl friends and watch this film on low res VHS tapes. The audio often wouldn't track well. Eventually I would pick up my own ""HI FI"" stereo copy of the film -that was still new technology. Later,I would snag a much better looking release on Laserdisc in my quest for the perfect copy. Finally, in the early 2000's the film was released on DVD. Alas it was a new, ""Director's Cut."" Usually, I prefer these cuts in movies, but in this case it was far inferior, and picture quality is middling. Maben added video game-like computer graphics, very dated looking even for then,  cutting away from the band and distracting from the film. Additional inteviews that he shot in 16mm black and white were added, but they only served to slow down the film. Digging into the sub menus, one could find the first cut of the film- but it is only the performances. Interviews with Nick mason ordering breakfast, “I’ll have egg, sausage, chips and beans – and a tea,” and  seeking in vain a pie without the crust. Along with the band’s reminiscences, Waters arguing about over active imaginations hearing a sibilance on a second cut of Obscured by Clouds ( foreshadowing their later acrimonious  breakup), and some very stoned and funny commentary by Gilmour and Waters, the former assuring us that they are not a ""Drug-orientated group. Trust us"" while being very red-eyed and obviously stoned, had audiences laughing quite strongly. None of that was visible on the DVD as a fluid cut. One could also find an interview with driector Maben, which is unfotunately not available on this release. What is available is a MUCH sharper (Finally) higher resolution presentation, with the same cut much as I saw on VHS, Laserdic, and finally in IMAX at the theaters last week, which should please most buyers. Unfortunately, they did not make the film available in 4K UHD, I suspect beacause they think that demand might not warrant it, but this copy is the highest quality home release we Floyd fans have ever had. Acoustically, much as in the IMAX presentation, this cut is a revelation. The soundtracks are available in three flavors:  2.0 uncompressed LCPM: linear pulse coded Modulation, which is the highest possible quality for a two channel stereo presentation and probably close to how it was originally presented in the best theaters back in the 70's. You also have 5.1 Dolby True HD surround, and Dolby Atmos, in which if you have the right speaksers and set up sounds will seem to emanate from your ceilings as well as to be a totally emersive wrap around experience. I had my head cocked and turning behind me in the  theater as I could hear Richard Wright and Dave Mason's separate voicies behind me, as well as sound swirling around the theater. The famed Steve Wilson has done an amazing job remixing and cleaning up these old recordings, which sound like today's best reference grade audio; that’s no small achievement for a 53 year old film. Subtitles are available in German, Italian, Spanish, and others- but no English, and they are limited to speech and not whilst singing, as is typical of most concert discs, unfortunately. The film is both surprising, at times humorous, and strangely meserizing, with Maben's tracking shots around drummer Nick Mason, and other cuts of the band bringing us into a near trance-like state. Images of frescos from ancient Pompeiian homes, and statues seem erie and fit in with shots of the city and the music, making for a unique experience. I would not throw out my old copy just for the additional interviews and Maben's commentary, but this is clearly the superior and only copy to have if you wish to see Pink Floyd in concert as they were intended to be seen. Online you can find an audio only recording of Nick Mason and Steven Wilson discussing the film after watching it with audience on its 2025 premiere. I’ve waited 40 years to see this properly released. Highly recommended.","R35NGOA4R8RE0A","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81x1Kl9o5JL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gsxQ0NXhL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FebKfDdvL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uUDJbnetL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"26 people found this helpful","FINALLY!

You will see an amazing combination of 4 hell of musicians: Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals), and David Gilmour (guitar, vocals). The original vinyl album was produced about 6 years after Syd Barrett left the band. So here you will see the creativity virtuosity of 4 out of the hell musicians: Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals), and David Gilmour (guitar, vocals). I was born in 1964, so my adolescence was marked by this band (despite the bad taste “disco wave” that marked the late 1970s and most of the 1980s).I truly think this blu ray release is visually and musically astonishing. Essentially, you have two main choices here. One is to go directly to the (non-live) concert at the Pompeii Amphitheatre. Here you will be astonished by individual and group creative process leading to the vinyl release. Alternatively, you go the same plus several inserts showing material from interviews to all members of the band. These exchanges are interesting as the reflect differences in personality when it comes to how strong or well-founded provide opinions.Finally, but not least, the images are also astonishing when it comes to the historical Pompeii images.Should I mention a negative issue, it you are interested in the blu ray release exclusively, the package is a bit disappointing. You get a cardboard envelope that opens in two halves with the blu ray in one and a small 6-page booklet. So, no standard rigid blu ray case.","RAFAR0OM8H6RX",,,,,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","A great treat from a great time in history of (progressive) rock","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAFAR0OM8H6RX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DXWM9N9P","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGT2IXH57JBGCH2Z4STTX33KBVJQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGT2IXH57JBGCH2Z4STTX33KBVJQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DXWM9N9P",,,,,,

En octobre 1971, Pink Floyd a déjà 5 albums à son actif et a terminé « Meddle » qui sortira à la fin du mois, un de leurs chefs d’œuvre, sans doute leur premier. Toujours en quête d’innovation, le groupe demande au réalisateur Adrian Maben de les filmer lors d’un concert sans public dans les ruines de l’amphithéâtre de Pompéi. « Une sorte d’anti-Woodstock » selon les termes de Maben, une expérience comme l’appelle les membres du groupe, misant sur la qualité sonore obsessionnelle du groupe, plutôt que « les réactions du public ». Les prises de vues sont réalisées du 4 au 7 octobre. Puis de nouvelles sessions sont enregistrées du 13 au 20 décembre à Paris pour compléter le tournage de Pompéi qui a subi quelques problèmes techniques mais qui démontraient aussi que le groupe avait de l’humour et du second degré (« Mademoiselle Nobs », blague sympa enregistrée…avec une chienne !). Une version audio remasterisée existait déjà dans le coffret « The Early Years 1972 » en 2016 avec 5 titres et la version alternative de « Careful with that axe, Eugene ». Cet enregistrement est donc loin d’être une découverte. Mais 2025 est l’occasion d’avoir (enfin) une version remixée en audio (2 CD) et vidéo, et pas par n’importe qui car il s’agit de Steven Wilson, musicien passionnant mais aussi un excellent ingénieur du son toujours sur les bons coups, permettant de redécouvrir quelques-uns des groupes qui l’ont influencé et lui font confiance pour le meilleur rendu sonore possible (Pink Floyd bien sûr mais aussi King Crimson, Marillion, Yes, The Who, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull…). A chaque fois, il frappe fort. Ici le son de chaque instrument ressort fabuleusement, en particulier la batterie de Mason, aucune comparaison avec la version d’origine ou même celle de 2016, le remixage était utile. Il faut dire que le son stéréo du documentaire était juste correct.Ce « Live at Pompeii » représente vraiment une charnière dans la carrière de Pink Floyd. Pas encore devenu le mastodonte qu’il sera à peine 2-3 ans plus tard, le groupe joue encore dans un style post-psychédélique avec une approche toujours expérimentale mais commence à s’en éloigner pour aller ailleurs. « A saucerful of secrets » offre l’occasion à Gilmour de triturer sa guitare comme jamais, tandis que Wright martèle son piano, que Waters s’acharne sur le gong, et que Mason n’en finit plus de frapper ses fûts. Le final du morceau tire plus vers le prog’ presque symphonique, dans une apothéose entre les claviers de Wright et la voix de Gilmour. Ce dernier sait tout aussi bien chanter d’une voix puissante ou éthérée, que distiller une atmosphère mystérieuse comme dans le lancinant « Careful with That Axe, Eugene ». Ambiance planante que vient rompre Waters par son cri strident et toujours aussi terrifiant. Des morceaux qu’on trouvait déjà dans le disque live de « Ummagumma », et qui appartiennent donc à la « première période » du groupe. Mais on sent un changement, une mutation… Si « Atom heart mother » marquait déjà la transition entre les sixties et seventies, mettant fin en quelque sorte au versant le plus psychédélique et expérimental du groupe, cette fin d’année 1971 annonce clairement les grandes heures du Floyd. Quand il joue le morceau en ce début du mois d’octobre à Pompéi, le groupe n’a pas encore sorti « Meddle » où figure la version studio de « Echoes ». Il arrivera dans les bacs quelques semaines plus tard. C’est donc presqu’un « inédit », au moins pour l’équipe de tournage. Cependant, cette pièce épique était en gestation depuis plusieurs mois, et était déjà jouée en concert depuis quelques mois. D’abord appelée « Nothing » (« rien »), puis « The son of nothing » (« le fils de rien ») et enfin « The return of the son of nothing » (« le retour du fils de rien ») en forme de boutade, cette suite de plusieurs idées musicales trouve son aboutissement en une longue symphonie rock. Mais à la différence de « Atom heart mother », le morceau « Echoes » comporte une partie chantée, et se joue uniquement avec le groupe, sans apport extérieur d’orchestre ou de chorale. Une pièce sublime qui préfigure l’apogée de Pink Floyd dans les années 70, de « The Dark side of the moon » à « The wall ». Pour ceux et celles qui souhaitent découvrir ce concert unique, je conseille d’abord la version vidéo très prenante mais pour les fans cette version audio est fantastique. J’ai monté le son et le résultat est tout simplement impressionnant.","R130D2A33A929D",,,,,,,,,,,,"Le Floyd d’avant Dark Side of the Moon, sans filet et passionnant.",,"Reviewed in France on May 6, 2025",,,,,"","B0DXWM9N9P",,,,,,

Immagino che l'eco naturale dell'anfiteatro romano possa aver contribuito a creare un'esperienza acustica irripetibile, aggiungendo un senso di spazialità e grandezza alle performance dei brani.UN PEZZO DA COLLEZIONE PER GLI APPASSIONATIIl formato in doppio LP rende questo prodotto un oggetto da collezione di sicuro valore per i fan dei Pink Floyd e per gli amanti della musica in vinile. La cura nella presentazione e la possibilità di possedere fisicamente un documento sonoro di un evento così leggendario aggiungono un fascino particolare a questo disco. È un modo per rivivere un momento storico della musica rock e per apprezzare l'arte di una band che ha saputo trascendere i generi.UN'IMMERSIONE NELLA LEGGENDAAnche per chi non ha familiarità con la performance originale, ascoltare questo disco può rappresentare un'occasione unica per immergersi nell'atmosfera di quel concerto straordinario. La musica dei Pink Floyd, con le sue atmosfere psichedeliche e i suoi paesaggi sonori evocativi, si sposa perfettamente con la solennità e la bellezza antica di Pompei, creando un'esperienza d'ascolto che va oltre la semplice riproduzione musicale.","R38C70HOV0TKL9",,,,,,,,,,,,"Un Viaggio Sonoro Emozionante nel Cuore di Pompei",,"Reviewed in Italy on May 12, 2025",,,,,"","B0DXWM9N9P",,,,,,

However the battery actually was giving me 4 hours which for a used MacBook that’s expected.- Day 3 I insert my jump drive into all the usb ports none worked, except the sd card. I reset the computer saw my usb drive come up.The screen went completely black. That’s the story.These computers are not even worth money. They should be given to children for free. What is an adult going to do with this?? You can’t even make a PowerPoint on here lol it’s so slow.  Do yourself a favor and only buy Macs with M1 or M2 chips. Or else you are not in the eco system.","R12PSG4EBS8TGX",,,,,,,,,,,,"You can do more with a first generation IPod Touch.

Here is my experience: (I ordered excellent condition for $299) when I got it came bubble wrapped, with a charger and with a “case” (a computer sticker skin). I didn’t need to plug it in it was already charged and I turned it on and set it up, I did run into a problem accepting the terms of service, you have to go back and press set up I cloud later in order to accept the terms, I added my I cloud after the fact, I texted people and FaceTimed time to make sure it worked and it did (sound and camera quality is great) , everything on my phone transferred over immediately contacts, photos, Apple Music, recent messages everything! I didn’t know you couldn’t download apps like Netflix and YouTube, you have to search up the website online sign into it and then set it up as a shortcut and as you can see in my last picture I have everything added into my bar and I turned the computer off and back on to make sure it didn’t sign me out,so far I’ve had no issues with battery drainage it has been open for a long time and barely went down, I also switched over the default browser to chrome to make it easier to use for school you can download that online as well, the only thing wrong with it to my knowledge is the tiny tiny dot on the screen (second pic) it turns black when it’s on and white when it’s turning off and I really don’t care about it I paid $300 and these computers go for over $1000 so I could really care less, overall I love this so much and I’m glad I bought it, it is an amazing deal and really recommend it for anyone wanting one","R21SYBCD235E7A","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81tjq9cCf1L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71p8c6qI8DL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QdmhMe3XL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RZcVrOyFL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ux6tAxhuL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XeI3HalhL._SY88.jpg",,,,,"45 people found this helpful","Perfect!

Overall, I’m happy with it, but there are a few things worth noting if you’re coming from the previous model.First, the video quality during the day doesn’t seem drastically improved l. It’s good, just not a big leap. However, the night video is noticeably better. Much clearer and brighter, which makes a big difference for late-night deliveries or just general peace of mind.One thing I really appreciated is that the app connects to live view much faster now. I’m not sure if that’s thanks to the new doorbell itself or the newer sync module, but the lag I used to experience is basically gone. Big win there.Audio has also improved, the robotic echo that plagued the previous model is not that bad now. Conversations are clearer and more natural, which is great for talking to delivery drivers or guests.Now, about the field of view - yes, it’s a bit wider, but that comes with more distortion around the edges. I installed mine in a narrow hallway, so the wider angle isn’t really useful for me and the distortion is kind of distracting. But if you’re placing it in an open area and want to capture more, you’ll probably see that as a positive.Another drawback is the absence of dual-band WiFi, which is somewhat disappointing given that some competitors have supported 5 GHz WiFi for quite some time.In short, this is a solid upgrade, especially for night vision, audio, and connection speed. Just be aware of the trade-offs if you’re in a tighter space like I am.","R28TAYJ3X6PMWA",,,,,,,,,,,"65 people found this helpful","Solid upgrade, especially at night","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28TAYJ3X6PMWA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DGQZ8JZK","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFE2URMFPWUQ4SW3JBVNCNEY257Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFE2URMFPWUQ4SW3JBVNCNEY257Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Black, Style: System (Doorbell + Sync Module), Configuration: Doorbell","B0DGQZ8JZK","Color","Black","Style","System (Doorbell + Sync Module)","Configuration","Doorbell"

And put on Breckin Meyer's, loveable obsessed, and lost yet prolific character John.Driven to such lengths, to make the world around him, better, but at the cost of loosing himself,in the process. Confronted and confounded by his comatose parents, who only selfishly blame him for the loss, of their number one son, from the war.They are so disturbingly twisted, from closed minded numbness, yet understandable, are just pathetically existing, in the denial they're fragile states, and weak minds can only handle.In They're delusive old fashioned minds, they are so far gone, that poor John can't get through to the rationale parts within them. If there ever were any to begin with. And so he is to fault for even being of the living, when his brother was taken, and killed in the war, in the middle East.John's goal is simple, get out of dodge, or the united states of blind denial, before Bush gets to run again, and yet make everything even more unbearable, for every American, trying to survive what's already happened before.In the sheer lunacy of the political viewless future, driving poor John to involve himself in a cultish counter, to fight the heartless, and selfishly safe pesidente, and his demented boyish fantasies, playing with dangerous toys, of congressional foritude. Leaving us with a bad tasting hand grenade in our mouths every day, till some idiot pulls out the pin.In Blue state John's views are not so far off the mark, that we can't identify with his need to get far away, along with a lovely blue yet, troubling, passenger of his. Enjoying the road trip past the good ol' USA boarder, into the safety and sane-er? Canadian embrace. After leaving Ma, and Pa kettle behind him, in their cobwebs of timeless loss and trauma filled home stead, John and his female Companion, drive forwards, into more uncertainty.But soooo unfairly far fetched look at Canadian way of life, where I could have done without the annoying hippy, love in audacity. Sharing of the mindless mentality, of these insufferable cretins, who trick John, who is only victimized into marrying the head, head case female. While his other female Companion is lost up in the confusion, not helped by a lunatic with a piece, not so Peace, and love in, after all. After his slight misunderstanding John apologizes to his real accompaniment and they do get out of Dodge- But his fellow American companion, has a secret of her own which makes the audience feel for her even more.But the Canadian's are made out to look really horrible, in this film.When in fact not everything is so bleak there, and not all the inhabitants living just miles from our NYC, line in the ground, are zombifyed lost in time, stone throwing, wastes of life, who only swig beer, and can't wait for hockey season, cause they have nothing else to live for...This was insulting, Canada is beautiful, and when the Holliweird machine, is too unfair to deal with, guess where the real actors go to escape.Cheaper to film in Canada, mom and dad USA we might sit back and enjoy many movies, and Tv shows from O'Canada, Actors comics, you just may have heard of, but just may have missed, or dismissed.Here's something, Canada's talent pool, can far out weigh the BS, from anything Holliweird can and has, rehashed over, and over again. And inspired writers beware, they will have less, than no respect for you in good'ol jolly LA LA Land.So think and, say what you will about Canada, after all closed mindness is our bread, pudding here on American soil.Sadly, you can take me away too John, after the after math of Bush in office, and everyone just keeps loosing, and loosing what little we had to begin with...By the way interesting take on the sheltered, hypocritical, devalued, dementia, that is left behind, a faded, emerald curtain we now live behind, born under the assumption all is good, you like conformity, and relax in the frightful stripped ident, that nothing can ever touch, your blythe acceptance of our spoon fed Govenmments BS.As they only take- take- and arrogantly take from us all... Till all is consumed, and nothing is left, for the ones, and they'er families, who really made this country great, once upon a time, for all concerned Eco wise, nature was more important, then over development, putting food on the table for all. People are surrounded, by comercialisim that sadly feeds us now, and we only eat it up, cause it's all we really believe in now.There is nothing good, or real about Reality TV. Just more spoiled rich idiots, who couldn't claim they even stepped into a Theater school, or audition for a role on stage, or screen. Yet they are everywhere, and concidered Celebrity status today, in a mind warping, self centered, trogs, my family and friends would think of as access whores, whiney and annoying beyond reason. Yeay! That's entertainment Jersey snore! Jerseylickus! How more blatant this disturbing fact is, guess grease balls is the word, with plastic shallow bitches, who haven't a clue what real was, if it sat on they're overly made up faces, and bent they're tin hub capped jewlery. Sad state, when we rely on spoiled rotten fakers, that would go up in a nice ball of flames, if you stood too close with a lit flame, flick my bic you cheap bitches! That's what we concider Tv at it's best folks and don't get me started on Americas got no talent, wow, X marks the target factor, giving a reason to tone deafeningly tune out the butchering of Janus Joplin, and John L. Because the sheep need to feel important too. As they're clueless fams are supportive, to a loss of breath. This is what's used to entertain us today. And speak about access, and selfish breeding live stock, 19 and counting, we help animal Hoarders to free themselves of their burdens, and rescue the poor animals that are in danger by their brain dead occupations, so why is a woman in our overly populated world, cheered for recklessly poping a poor defenceless child from her cavenous mouth every second? Shouldn't someone save those poor kids, and give them moms and dads who can't breed a litter every year? Then take that cow out to pasture, and tie it's tubes?! It's sick. Not reality, she's a dam'n Mutant, who could take over the world, with her hungry 19 mouths and consuming! Sad.We are all pawns, of the brain draining machinations of the madness, that fills our entertainment hours, and canceling shows for the Net works is like wacking your family and friends, merciless slaughter, done with sensless percission. As Tyranical as any idiotic leader, heartless, bloated, rich, undeserving, arrogant, inbred, lying, piece of shite, man in charge...Wow, a vicious circle, ah, pyscopath, deficiant insect.So, to sum up, if your still with me, that is. Was John so wrong, to want to escape an uncertainty, and even more bleaker future to come, now thanks to our beloved, and clueless, and fearless, fool of a leader? Mockery of a decent man! Whoever wrote Blue state, was a genus and he fore saw, the comical panic, of a realistic danger, we all should have taken into account, before prudant boy led us all astray. Now innocent families are suffering, from his arrogant narcistic need, for more access, more toys of destruction, and more bodies to play out his selfish pursuit for oil, wow, Well Go on comfort yourself, with the denial that it's okay, we are Americans, and nothing could ever be, or go wrong, to, or for us, as we continue living blissfully, with blinders on, right? Ah, 9- 11 come to mind people? It's so sad...Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all we see...Just words to wake up by, from another more famous, and dearly missed, John. He sang alot about real Peace brother. Till some waste of life silenced him.You figure it out, I'm wasting time, and breath, I know, As usual, Sad right? - Lo BB","R3P6UI0CZUMKZS",,,,,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","Breckin Meyer!!

This is a low-key but powerful film that deals with the frustration of living in a politically apathetic country. But John has other reasons for his beliefs and Chloe is not just looking for a ride, she is going to Canada to get out of a second tour in Iraq.Meyer (who can do more than comedy) and Paquin are perfect in their roles.

Mit dem Kombi geht's Richtung Norden.Fahrtbegleiterin ist Chloe (Anna Paquin), eine politisch unkorrekte, toughe, junge Frau, die vor etwas davonzulaufen scheint. Etappe für Etappe, Hotelstopp für Hotelstopp geben beide ihre Geheimnisse preis und kommen einander näher. In Kanada angekommen, erweist sich die neue Wahlheimat sowohl für John als auch für Chloe nicht als das gelobte Land. Scheinehen und skurrile Hinterwäldler sind eben doch nicht das Wahre. Schließlich stellen sich beide ihren Ängsten, und das Roadmovie nimmt eine Kurve Richtung Ausgangspunkt.Anna Paquin und Breckin Meyer machen ihre Sache gut.

Far more than the minimum requirements for this item.The first thing that happened when I installed the software is that it failed because I had Core Isolation on and that was preventing the installation of some drivers. In order to install the software I had to turn this off. That should have been my first red flag, having to remove security in order for something to be installed. But installation apparently finished, so I launched the software and it worked. I checked for updates, and one was available, so I installed it. After that I launched the software again and was informed that I am not a registered user now (after the fact I read reviews of this product and saw that I am NOT the only one), and the app quit.So I uninstalled everything using the Uninstall feature. But that doesn't uninstall everything, I still had to go to Installed Apps and remove what it left behind. Against my better judgement, I turned off Core Isolation and reinstalled the software. After installation it asked if I wanted to install the update. Figuring the previous failure was the culprit of the registration issue, I did. Launching the app, I was no longer a registered user and the app quit.So, I uninstalled everything again, reinstalled and did NOT apply the update. The software then launched and I was able to start transferring the video.  The video capture was nothing but choppy video and audio filled with static (NOT in the source tape). Unusable captures. It was then that I decided to just send it all back.After uninstalling everything to repack it, I turned Core Isolation back on and was informed that there were 5 or 6 incompatible drivers preventing me from turning this security feature back on. So the uninstall feature leaves behind the drivers that required Core Isolation to be turned off, so it could not be turned back on. Luckily the System Security app tells which drivers are incompatible, so I was able to find them in c:\windows\system32 and rename them so they would not load, and I was able to reactivate Core Isolation.So, at least with Windows 11, in order to use this software be prepared to turn off Core Isolation forever (or until you remove the software and the incompatible drivers), be prepared to never upgrade the software because you will no longer be a registered user (of course you can PURCHASE the newest software after having purchased this) and be prepared for unusable video/audio capture.","R2NY8L1K3D3P7P",,,,,,,,,,,"4 people found this helpful","READ THE 1-2 STAR REVIEWS FIRST","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NY8L1K3D3P7P/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAS14KI","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AETWE76JMKRI3O6CQ5TI4NL2EKLA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETWE76JMKRI3O6CQ5TI4NL2EKLA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B00EAS14KI",,,,,,

Some reviewers praise the quick install and immediate results, and some start blaming software issues, and then hardware issues. This was with all brands, not just Pinnacle. So maybe like you, I was totally confused. Who do I believe?RELYING ON SOMEONE'S KEY COMMENT...There was one reviewer who's comments I couldn't get out of my mind. He praised the Dazzle DVC-100 capture device by saying, and I'll paraphrase; "".....it's (Dazzle) the most robust device, and worth purchasing the package, if only for the device... just toss the software and use freeware..."" I think that guy's review became my subliminal message that ultimately drove me back to Amazon and my ""clicking on my Prime button to place my order!""WHAT ABOUT THAT ""PATCH"" FOR WIN 8.1 (?)...My Dazzle arrived this Saturday, December 6th, '14. which is important to know, because evidently the ""patch"" that many have complained about needing to download for Windows 8.1, well, it's evidently not needed anymore. I say that because after loading my software, doing a cold-reboot, and then trying to load the patch, I got an error message saying that the patch would not be compatible with my system software, or something along those lines. I bypassed the upload, and went directly to using the Capture Device and the stock software.BOTTOM LINE, IT DID WHAT I NEEDED, AND THE AUDIO WAS SYNCED WITH THE VIDEO...1. I set up my Circa 1990's Kyocera/Sony Video8 tape camera-recorder-playback system.2. Played back a Video8 tape (circa 1990's and monophonic audio) into the Dazzle capture device.3. Started the software, which took a while to load for the first time.4. Intuitively figured out that I was going to ""Import"" from the Capture device.5. Started the playback and saw preview video in the program window; clicked on ""Start Capture.""6. Let the program and the playback unit run for the next hour and a few minutes.7. When the tape had played out, I clicked on ""Stop Capture.""8. ""Stop Capture"" started an ""auto save"" to the default VIDEOS folder in Windows.9.  Once saved to the default folder, I did a copy and paste to my photo album.Bottom line, the copied tape came out great as an MPG, and I then used Window to burn that one hour file (a little over 3 gigs) onto a DVD disk.I WANTED TO QUICKLY AND EASILY ARCHIVE SOME OLD VIDEO TAPES, AND IT WORKED...Based on my expectations, this package did exactly what I wanted. I've since recorded to my computer from my Video8 and VHS systems. I'm not concerned about ""producing"" any videos right now. But if I do, I'll be able to pick from a number  of programs. Had I used the editing function, and enjoyed the same success as with the basic function of transferring analog to digital files, I'd have given Pinnacle-Corel a 5 out of 5. Based on my early success, I'm comfortable giving the 4 out of 5 stars.","R3KYIYEE6F11IX",,,,,,,,,,,"320 people found this helpful","So maybe like you, I was totally confused","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KYIYEE6F11IX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAS14KI","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2014",,,"amzn1.account.AFC3ISN6XXI6FNSMTQRQM5E35FHQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFC3ISN6XXI6FNSMTQRQM5E35FHQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B00EAS14KI",,,,,,

That said, this still shines on ordinary machines, gaming machines, mini PCs and laptops! I was pretty amazed at how fast it moved on different platforms. From Zen to Zen+ to Zen 5, it still works well. GPU acceleration makes this even faster. All of the bells and whistles are here. There are a metric ton of fades, wipes and transitions in general. There is canned sound and stock video sources as well that you can access to punch up your video using this software. The timeline scrubs easily with a fast PC even in 4K. The software itself is easy to install and get running but be aware that there is a learning curve. If you have use software like this before you'll find the usual tools if you hunt. If you have never used software like this before you can reference the manual, videos online and different forums to get a good handle on the package. It makes it easy to be real. Compared to say, Davinci Resolve, this is simple to use. Yet it's just as powerful in most ways. I made a few videos with Vegas and I was happy with the output and the ease of use I had on my first project. Unfortunately I edited a battle rap video so i will not be uploading that but needless to say it was seamless and the audio popped. I even added deeper bass with a 12dB per octave punch at 60 Hz! This is quality software at a good price.

The seamless integration of video and audio editing, combined with powerful post-production features, makes it ideal for creating high-quality videos. The timeline interface is particularly user-friendly, giving me easy access to all the essential editing tools—color grading, effects, filters, and compositing—without feeling overwhelmed.What really sets VEGAS Pro apart is its AI-powered smart editing features. The ability to create masks, voiceovers, and subtitles is made incredibly easy with the help of artificial intelligence. One standout feature is the text-based editing, which allows me to edit interviews or dialogues as if I were editing a simple text document. This has been a game-changer for efficiency, especially when working with long video recordings. The OFX and VST plug-in interfaces provide even more flexibility, letting me expand VEGAS Pro with thousands of additional plug-ins, making it highly customizable for my needs.The system requirements are modest enough that it runs smoothly on my setup with Windows 10 and 16GB of RAM, and I've never experienced any major performance issues. As a user of several video editing software programs over the years, VEGAS Pro stands out for its ability to streamline my workflow and keep me in the creative flow. It’s clear that VEGAS Creative Software, a US-based company, has put a lot of thought and passion into making this software not only functional but also intuitive and efficient for creators.In conclusion, VEGAS Pro has quickly become my go-to video editing software.

Allerdings war meine Sorge unnötig, denn man kann die Software auch herunterladen. Das Installationsfenster hat mir dann aber kurz die Nerven geraubt, weil ich partout die Auswahl des Installationslaufwerks nicht finden konnte. Nach der Installation muss das Produkt noch registriert werden, und dann kann es losgehen. Was mich allerdings nach einiger Zeit der Nutzung irritiert, ist, dass sich das Programm immer wieder kurz neu registrieren muss. Das passiert bei mir täglich. Man kennt es ja von Abo-Modellen, dass diese sich in regelmäßigen Abständen updaten wollen, aber bei einer festen Lizenz finde ich das unnötig. Vielleicht finde ich noch, wie man das Ganze abstellt. Aktuell finde ich das etwas unbeholfen.Allgemein:Ich bin kein exzessiver Cutter, aber ich habe in der Vergangenheit mit Programmen wie Final Cut und Resolve gearbeitet. Insgesamt wird man sich recht schnell zurechtfinden, wenn man ähnliche Programme in der Vergangenheit genutzt hat. Natürlich braucht es, wie immer, eine gewisse Umgewöhnungszeit. Ansonsten ist die Oberfläche modern und man findet sich gut zurecht. Es wird viel Drag and Drop unterstützt, und insgesamt ist das meiste intuitiv.Leistung:Ich war zu Beginn etwas verwundert, denn Vegas lief nicht so wirklich flüssig. Ich kann nur empfehlen, die Einstellungen zu überprüfen. Den dynamischen RAM habe ich stark erhöht, da dieser standardmäßig sehr niedrig eingestellt war. Selbes gilt für die Grafikkartenbeschleunigung, die ebenfalls ausgestellt war. Mit einer guten Grafikkarte und einem leistungsfähigen System kann man hier einiges optimieren. Hier heißt es probieren und schauen, was das System hergibt.Features allgemein:Vegas hat alles, was man so gebrauchen kann, und der Kreativität sind kaum Grenzen gesetzt. Das Programm komplett auszuschöpfen, werden die wenigsten. Es gibt unzählige Transitions, Effekte und Tools, die das Leben einfacher machen. Nur die Vorlagen der Bauchbinden finde ich recht mäßig. Hier musste ich mir erst ein paar eigene Layouts zusammenbasteln. Das geht aber insgesamt problemlos, und es gibt viele Einstellungsmöglichkeiten. Mit Keyframes kann man dann noch spezifischer werden.AI-Features:Was ich ziemlich cool finde und auch nutze, ist das AI-Feature „Speech to Text“. Damit kann man Tonspuren in ein Transkript umwandeln und auf Basis der Textblöcke schneiden. Das Analysieren der Tonspuren klappt insgesamt sehr gut, und bei Bedarf lassen sich Textstellen leicht korrigieren. Mit diesem Feature wurde eine weitere Möglichkeit geschaffen, punktgenau zu schneiden oder auch Textstellen schneller zu finden. Untertitel können ebenfalls generiert und direkt integriert werden. Allerdings ist die Markierung im Transkript etwas unintuitiv – Shift + Klick markiert die Textblöcke, das hat mich anfangs etwas Zeit gekostet.„Text to Speech“ finde ich ebenfalls recht fancy. Hier kann man Text mittels AI in Tonspuren umwandeln. Je nach Sprache hat man eine große Auswahl an möglichen Stimmen. Für Deutsch stehen z. B. 10 verschiedene Stimmen zur Verfügung. Ich präferiere Katja und Maja, die für eine KI-Stimme recht gut klingen. Bei deutschen Texten mit englischen Begriffen muss man eventuell etwas nachbessern. Auch hier kann man die Stimmlage anpassen oder die Geschwindigkeit ändern. Dieses Feature hat definitiv Potenzial für alle möglichen Zwecke.„AI-Masking“ habe ich bisher noch nicht ausgiebig getestet, aber schnell generierte Masken sind nie verkehrt. Vom „AI-Sharpening“ bin ich bisher nicht so überzeugt – es wirkt eher, als würde nur die Klarheit erhöht. Überzeugt mich vom Look her nicht, das wäre eher etwas für Videos mit einem etwas kantigen Stil.Insgesamt ein gutes Schnittprogramm mit vielen Möglichkeiten und einer dauerhaften Lizenz – ideal für alle, die Abo-Modelle nicht mögen und nach einer soliden Alternative suchen.","R1D97V01OSFWI2",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gutes Schnittprogramm mit viel Potenzial und cleveren AI-Features.",,"Reviewed in Germany on October 16, 2024",,,,,"","B0DB2J8SNL",,,,,,

Lieferung / InstallationDie Lieferung Erfolg etwas Oldschool per CD und Freischaltcode in einem Pappschuber.Negativ erstmal, dass bei Lieferung das Siegel schon gebrochen war, was laut Aufdruck einen Umtausch ausschließt. Da sei der Hinweis erlaubt, dass man in dem Fall auch nicht nur einen Papierstreifen verwenden darf, der beim Handling schon mal einreißen kann, sondern das Produkt dann blistern oder verschweißen müsste.Unprofessionell ging es bei der Installation auch weiter, weil der Installer von der Windows 10 Firewall erstmal geblockt wurde. Nicht weil das Programm böse ist - weil es in einen temporären Ordner schreiben wollte. Weiter kam man nur, wenn man manuell die Standard-Settings der Windows-Firewall anpasst.Für die Kundenerfahrung bis hier hin wäre es leider nur ein Stern geworden - da muss Magix in Puncto Qualitätssicherung noch erwachen werden.2. RegistrierungNach Installation erfolgt die Registrierung der Software mittels Portal und Zusenden eines Freischaltcodes per Email.Auch eher ein Kundenerlebnis der 2000er aber hat alles funktioniert.Vielleicht absichtlich etwas Retro-Feelung aus der Zeit, wo der nonlineare Videoschnitt auf die Home-Computer kam.3. Start und erste ProjekteNun beginnen die 5 Sterne und auf Anhieb taucht ein recht professionelles UI auf, was an marktübliche Schnittprogramme erinnert. Dezente aber sehr produktive Assistenten und Templates erleichtern das schnelle Einrichten eines Projektes.Im Vergleich zu Produkten aus Fernost oder der Konsumer-Ecke auch keine Werbung oder nerviges Nachkobern von Features.3. Erste Projekte / GPU LeistungVEGAS geht sehr effizient mit den Computerressourcen um.Pre-rendern, Suche, Indexstreifen - alles recht flüssig, selbst auf Standardhardware (i7 + SSD, 64GB RAM)4. Erste Highlites die FilterEffekte und Filter sind reichlich vorhanden und dabei auch angenehm wenig Kitsch sondern ""Industriestandard"" mit dem man professionell arbeiten kann.Schonmal Extrasternchen für das Verketten von Masken und Filtern - womit sich recht schnell professionelle Effekte erzielen lassen - gerade in Zusammenhang mit den KI-Features.5. KI-Features - die wahre Stärke von VEGAS Pro 22.Bei Punkt 4 war ich froh, das ich etwas ebenbürtiges zum Home-Producer-Standard aus dem Hause Cuppertino gefunden habe. Aber - jetzt kommen die KI Funktionen.Das retuschieren der alten Super-8 Aufnahmen durch Korrektur der Blende, Interpolation von wackeligen 18fps Sequenzen war auf Anhieb ein HIngucker. Gleiches gilt auch für verrausche VHS Sequenzen.Für aktuelle Produktionen ist der Motiontracker sicherlich ein erwähnenswertes Highlite der wiederum mit einer Maske verknüpft werden kann.Somit können z.B. Sprechblasen in der Sequenz ganz einfach dem Sprecher folgen. (siehe 4)In Kombination mit Vordergrund/ Hintergrund-Separation kann aus laufenden Sequenzen die Akteure (oder der Hintergrund) als Overlay in andere Sequenzen übernommen werden.(ohne Greenscreen)Das nur als ein kleines Highlite, alles hier komplett zu Beschreiben wäre zu Abendfüllend.Auch ist der 3rd Party Marketplace für Plugins erwähneswert - kann ich aber nicht als FEature des Produktes in die Bewertung mit eingehen lassen.Scripting und Steuerung per API sind ebenfalls möglich.Scripting machte auf den ersten Blick einen sehr guten Eindruck, würde aber mindestens ein Projekt und damit mehrere Wochen benötigen, um es vernünftig bewerten zu können.Auf jeden fall ist scripting + KI-Filter + Batchverarbeitung möglich, was bequem das Auffrischen alter Videos ermöglicht.Für Entwickler gibt es ein SDK auf Anfrage, um eigene Plugins zu entwickeln.Das ist auf jeden Fall eine sehr lohnenswerte Strategie - der Ansatz hat Potential für eine Kreativcommunity.Fazit: 5 Sterne Wert, da es sich von den Features und Bedienbarkeit deutlich von Konsumer-Produkten abhebt und durchaus in der professionellen Liga mitspielen kann.","R19KSHKB3PXCI7",,,,,,,,,,,,"Professionelles UI, Produktive Filter und super KI-Features",,"Reviewed in Germany on October 12, 2024",,,,,"","B0DB2J8SNL",,,,,,

Ich freue mich, wenn ich Ihnen weiterhelfen konnte.In einem kleinen Kartonumschlag mit den notwendigen Zugangsdaten kam das Programm unbeschadet bei mir an. Die Installation und Inbetriebnahme verliefen problemlos.Als technikaffiner PC-User seit mehr als 25 Jahren konnte ich einem Test dieses Programms nicht widerstehen, da man sich in den Jahren ja doch so einiges an Programmen und Tools angeguckt hat, mit welchen man seinen Alltag im Digitalen bestreitet. Video-Software wie diese nutze ich vorrangig zum Erstellen von Familienvideos, seit der Geburt unserer Kleinen wieder umso häufiger.Das Programm lässt sich wirklich sehr schön bedienen und wer MAGIX kennt, wird sich hier schneller zurechtfinden. Funktionen und Möglichkeiten gibt es hier wirklich immens viele - und leider ist auch bei vielem, was tiefer in die Materie geht, eine mehr oder minder intensive Einarbeitung nötig, welche sich aber am Ende auch lohnt, Online-Tutorials helfen hier! Mit Willen und ein wenig Zeit merkt man immer mehr, wie alles ineinandergreifen kann und dass man dann doch recht fluffig durch die Features durchklicken kann.Je mehr man sich damit beschäftigt, desto schönere Erinnerungen kann man sich schaffen. Von Intros, über Texte, von schicken Übergängen, über Musik, eigene Audioaufnahmen, Schnitt, und vielem mehr hat man hier alles zur Hand, was man für wirklich hochwertige Produktionen braucht, die nachher auch wirklich was hermachen. Das KI-Reframing ist absolut genial und ich will gar nicht mehr ohne arbeiten, gerade wenn man sowohl Hoch- als auch Querformat-Aufnahmen von seine Liebsten hat.Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn: Wer bereit ist, sich ein wenig mehr in das Programm einzuarbeiten als mit 10 Minuten Handbuch lesen, der kann sich hier wirklich ein aufgezeichnetes Fundament für die Erstellung grandioser Videos legen, das für mich als technikaffiner ""Amateur"" weit über die Ergebnisse anderer Tools hinausgeht.

It seems to me that if a woman believes that she is a man and begins the process of changing into a man, then that individual would most likely want to be with a woman. In fact, the idea that a woman would begin taking testosterone so that she could become a gay man seems completely ludicrous to me.The second couple consists of two postoperative male-to-female transgender persons. For the same reasons,this coupling seems as unlikely to me as the first. If a man believes that he is a woman on the inside and goes to all the trouble to surgically alter himself, this individual is going to want to date a man, not another woman. Also, the idea that two people are so in love with each other that they are willing to surgically alter their appearance so that they can look alike is kind of creepy.Unfortunately, because of the unbelievable characters, poor cinematography, and a weak storylines I can only give this movie one star.","R1C4SRIH5ZAKN3",,,,,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","Far Fetched","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C4SRIH5ZAKN3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C67XNO","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2013",,,"amzn1.account.AELRWDJ6ALYKJG7MXOFDXEDUDCAA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELRWDJ6ALYKJG7MXOFDXEDUDCAA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B005C67XNO",,,,,,

I tried very hard. but it can be summed up in a single word: awkward. And just to make it clear, I am an FTM Transgender person. I understand that they were trying to probably make the point that Trans people have real people problems too. The whole time I was watching it I kept wondering WHY I just didn't turn it off. I kept hoping it would make some deep point or miraculously in the end it all made sense... but it didn't. This comes across like a college student's film piece.Warning: SPOILERSOne couple has the 'happy ending', the single person commits suicide, and the other couple obviously has a baby. The suicide is just a stupid cop-out. By the time we get to the big emotional scene preceding it all I could think of is that it was just one hair away from being a temper tantrum, like if the person caused enough of a ruckus that the uninterested person would change their mind. So. Freakin. Stupid. (I have struggled with suicide over the years so the topic itself I do not take lightly. It's just how it was handled in here that I find to be totally stupid.) But the absolutely biggest thing that ticks me off is the baby issue. Why? Because once it hit the point where the Trans guy said he didn't know if he wanted the baby (after previously expressing growing up never wanting kids) that the REST of the focus on the situation was about how the CIS GUY felt! Seriously, the Trans guy does not say ANYTHING about his feelings after that. As a Trans guy I can tell you that it would be one screwed up emotional mess for him to have to sort through even before dealing with the crippling dysphoria of dealing with a body (let alone another life) doing things that completely conflict with the internal perception of their own gender. And the last you see of the Trans guy, he's laying there in bed, massively pregnant, not talking, eyes not open, no expression at all. It just leaves me with the really sour feeling that he felt as if he had to follow the expectation placed on him by others and not what was right for him. So it really felt like the 'real (cis) man' was in control and the Trans guy would just have to be the girl because he got pregnant. This pisses me off to no end. In healthy Trans relationships, traditional gender roles normally do not apply. And they never answered the question how/if the hormones would affect the baby!Sloppy work on the storytelling all the way around and it just ended up really strange.","R2CQER8O3JNVGM",,,,,,,,,,,,"I wish I would have passed on it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CQER8O3JNVGM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C67XNO","Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2018",,,"amzn1.account.AFKZTHT56ZXRVHEJYIXH3IIJ2JTA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKZTHT56ZXRVHEJYIXH3IIJ2JTA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B005C67XNO",,,,,,

It's about the extra/unordinary lives of trans-people. The irony of them. They are saving the world from the tyranny and destruction of binary thinking (male/female), yet still long to be part of that oppressive system, while struggling to free themselves from it. In the film, a trans man gets pregnant by his bi-sexual lover. The trans man cannot escape his femaleness despite having removed his breasts and grown a beard (extraordinary!). But all they can talk about is about arrangements for living together and healthcare (unordinary!). I couldn't have been anymore engrossed in this film -- it is photographic -- a slideshow of carefully composed shots. It's a poem weaving simple visual and auditory narratives about trans sexuality among other things, life. The story is sweet, funny, bizarre, incoherent, suspenseful and utterly slow. It waxes and wanes because after ""shocking"" reveals, there is no urgency. The characters just wait for the phone to ring. They stare into space, have meaningless conversations. It's as if it's easy to be a trans person in America. There is no conflict other than self-acceptance. Yet, that is the one of the biggest struggles of trans people, which the film poignantly portrays. Cynthia, one of the main characters, you can't take your eyes off of and she evokes much sympathy from the viewer. We are invested in her plight. If only the rest of the cast was that good (lines were butchered: no intonation, inflection or purpose). Nick is the second most empathetic character and he's not even trans.  He was more likable than the other three trans characters. Was that intentional? In the end, this might have been a better movie if the actors hadn't been asked to act. However, I see the point. Trans people have to perform a gender -- masculine, feminine -- a persona that doesn't come easily to them because they've been the opposite gender for so many years. The actors struggle with these characters though these are their true-life stories being told. The whole ensemble reiterates the idea that identity is not easily defined. The movie is a film student's final project -- bad lighting, contradictory shots/images/ideas, shoe-string budget -- but it's still one of the best films I've seen in years. You won't be disappointed.","R2CF9GEIS4TPJ5",,,,,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","The story is sweet, funny","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CF9GEIS4TPJ5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C67XNO","Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2016",,,"amzn1.account.AETOWCYEPUBUNNRMGJ3H6ULVIARQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETOWCYEPUBUNNRMGJ3H6ULVIARQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B005C67XNO",,,,,,

USB charging is easy, and the lights came with 2 short USB cords for charging. I do not know how long a charge will last yet. We just got them.

Y hablando de cargarlas, este es otro punto a su favor, simplemente hay que retirarlas y usar un cable usb-c (cualquiera que tengamos por casa o el incluido en el paquete) con un indicador en verde cuando la carga esta completa.Su precio es muy bueno para la construcción elegante y resistente y la versatilidad que tienen.Como única pega, que más que pega es recomendación, para ser un producto perfecto tendría que tener una regulación para el tiempo que se mantiene encendido tras dejar de detectar movimiento ya que sus 25 segundos no se pueden modificar.","R1SGZ1FCOKD7L9",,,,,,,,,,,,"Armarios y pasillos perfectamente iluminados",,"Reviewed in Spain on April 28, 2025",,,,,"","B0F1C56SR1",,,,,,

Se pegan con las tiras que ya trae incorporadas, y listo. Para hacerlo correcto lo mejor es dejar los imanes pegados a la lámpara para tener ya la posición de los mismos, y presionar sobre la superficie que deseemos; así quedará perfectamente a su medida.

La fácil colocación/descolocación permite retirarla para cargarla muy fácilmente.Durante la carga tiene una luz, roja es cargando, verde ya está cargado.

Tiene 4 posiciones de funcionamiento, dos de ellas es para totalmente encendida o apagada, y las otras dos son antagonistas en funcionamiento. Una detecta en oscuras cuando haya luz como al abrir un armario cerrado y se enciende; o lo contrario, se enciende y al detectar la luz se apaga. Es lo que el fabricante define como “acciones”. Tras unos 20 segundos se apaga o enciende según corresponda. Y tiene memoria. Funcionará según se haya seleccionado anteriormente su temperatura de color e intensidad de brillo.Si a todo lo anterior que tiene un comportamiento irreprochable, añadimos que “por su precio vienen 2 unidades” poco más se puede añadir.

My heart sank into my stomach...I'm a gamer on a budget, so i thought this was a great deal, but read the reviews and prepared for the worst. I even explained my situation and concerns to a local Gamestop employee and got him to set aside an Elite Series 2 box for me in case this Amazon Renewed one came dead on arrival.Then, the moment came to unbox. I was pleasantly surprised to see the carrying case was included and in excellent condition. Opened it up, and the suspense was tangible as i examined the contents and tested the controller...It worked PERFECTLY! No missing parts! No broken parts! No filthy controller!

I know these are refurbished and it says in description like new. I understand there maybe some wear on the item and 3rd party accessories (like charger cord) however when you say they are tested I would expect there to be no issues with the controllers. Both controllers had issues though both were different. The first one had an issue with the 4 way controller in that it would drift up after being pressed down and stick. That one was rather clean and had the original charger cord, however I sent it back (MISTAKE) the replacement for that was worse!! It wasn't as clean, the charger cord was 3rd party but it was MUCH shorter--if you are going to use a 3rd party item at least make it the close to the same as you can. This controller itself the flip paddles on the back the give on the top placement for short flippers was way off and couldn't be used. If I placed larger flippers it worked fine but then I couldn't use the bottom ones --so in a sense I lost 2 of the 4 extra control features.I contacted the seller and the 1st exchange went well--the 2nd they never responded so I just am sending it back for a refund and will save the extra 100 to get a new custom one.","RJ1WUGHQZ3H66",,,,,,,,,,,"10 people found this helpful","Item itself is good but not this company's refurbishment version","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ1WUGHQZ3H66/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08PCBDR2D","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2021",,,"amzn1.account.AGSNTULBP4QP4BRQ5EPHX7GMGA3A","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGSNTULBP4QP4BRQ5EPHX7GMGA3A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B08PCBDR2D",,,,,,

Despite its ultra-compact size — arguably the smallest EDC light I’ve ever used — it has quickly replaced most of the flashlights I used to carry daily.What sets it apart is how effortlessly it fits into my lifestyle. It slips perfectly into the coin pocket of my jeans and is so lightweight that I often forget I’m even carrying it. The rotating clip and the 180-degree swiveling head add an incredible amount of versatility — I can attach it to my shirt pocket without it sagging or mount it on the brim of a cap for hands-free work. These thoughtful design choices make it one of the most practical lights I’ve ever owned.One standout feature is the rotating dial used to adjust brightness. It makes switching modes incredibly intuitive and smooth — no double-clicks, long-presses, or confusing combinations. Just turn the wheel and go. For such a small flashlight, the G5 is impressively bright. In my usage pattern (running it on max brightness for 1–5 minutes every 5 minutes), the battery consistently lasted through the entire night. It probably could’ve gone even longer, but I usually top it off daily just out of habit.Build quality is top-tier. There are no rattles, creaks, or loose parts — everything feels solid and refined. It has the tactile feel of a premium, well-engineered tool. Simply put, the G5 doesn’t just feel like another flashlight — it feels like a precision instrument designed with real-world use in mind.In short, the Wuben G5 delivers a near-perfect combination of size, functionality, and quality. It’s a flashlight that disappears in your pocket but shines when you need it most.","R15Z62YPNXTK3N","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813A6JJT4pL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,"5 people found this helpful","Compact Powerhouse That Redefines EDC","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15Z62YPNXTK3N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DT6S7363","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGQ2OLXZCHKDPJICS6FPAAQR3NJA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQ2OLXZCHKDPJICS6FPAAQR3NJA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DT6S7363",,,,,,

It’s sorta crazy how many different things they packed into such a tiny package; swivel, RGB, signal modes, magnet, clip, lanyard hole, step-less dial, waterproofing, charge indicator, charging status, and the now mandatory USB-C. Seriously, read the manual because it does so much more than it lets on. And all in the size of pretty much a tic-tac box.The swivel head is NOT a gimmick! You can aim light exactly where you want on a work surface… or use the magnet to stick to the hood of a car and aim it at the fuse box, or clip it to a cap and aim either in front of you or down at something you’re working on.Here’s a random thing I like about it… we have a 2 year old that’s learning colors… he’s obsessed with this flashlight. I put it on RGB mode, which turns the dial into a color selector, and he rolls through the colors and we name them together. We’ve been playing with it almost non-stop. I have to hide it when he’s distracted so he can do other stuff too. LOL!Well, suffice it to say that Wuben has made another cool and actually practical flashlight.

An added elements of ""clever"" are the rotating head, the dialing of white brightness or color, and the ""pull out and rotate around"" pocket clip.The light is a reasonable compromise, but ultimately is a ""clever pocket pal"" to show friends more than actually use as an Every Day Carry item of utility.Here's a few comments on that compromise: The dialing for brightness is perhaps not the best method of User Interface; the minimum and maximum brightness levels aren't overwhelming, but adequate; the impact of 10 Lumens of colored light output will range from perceivably dimmer to brighter to the eye, depending on the nm (color) of the output, but again, generally useful; the rotating head is useful in conjunction with the pivoting clip for use on a cap or on a strap or in-hand, but the head's size, appearance of construction, and single point of attachment is a bit worrisome for long term durability; after a few pocket carries, the black finish has worn off at corners; the magnetic base isn't confidently strong enough to suspend the light horizontally (width-wise).Now another point of ""clever"" is the use of a three position slide switch to uncover the USB-C recharge port, unlock the light, and lock the light. The idea is clever, but long term durability is a question.The use of the rotating dial and single push button affords a reasonable and simple method of User Interface, as does the slide-switch / port cover.  All in all, this light is quite clever and reasonably useful, too.  Hopefully, if it is carried and used carefully, it will be a fun and useful light.Four out of five for compromises in performance and construction, even knowing that at this price point compromises are understandable - but I'd have paid more for a more ""solid"" product with these clever features.","R2CAUKDHZ3LVH3",,,,,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","In a few words - A Very Clever Pocket Light, A Pocket Pal to Show Friends, but Useful, too.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CAUKDHZ3LVH3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DT6S7363","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHKRQPFRTLXTEBU347JS5FKLSI7Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKRQPFRTLXTEBU347JS5FKLSI7Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DT6S7363",,,,,,

Whiel AE shares some of SA's flaws it at least holds together better and polishes up the worst of them. Articulation is quite good all around. This is a standard SRC super poseable non transforming offering of a robot that on screen is a combiner. The SRC does not combine or come apart. Much like the Sentai/Power Rander robots this one is just a single poseable action figure.It's a strangely proportioned figure, but that stems from the shows CGI robot design, not Bandai. With big honking canoe feet and wasp waist. The printing and paint application is excellent all around. The ""soloar"" wings are a vast improvement over the SA. They clip onto the legs when not deployed and are much much sturdier. (It's not like they could have been made worse).Accessories are strange. You have the giant fisted extending super punch forced perspective pieces, similar to the SA. But these seem a little better designed. Plus you have a swirling vortex effects plastic dish to punch through and a sign shouting out your move. Different, but I suspect all will be left in the box.Aquarian Evol is a great little robot for fans of the show. While there are tons of Merchandise out there for AE, this is one of the few versions of  the actual robot the show is named after. And probably the only merchandise from the show that is not sporting more cleavage than is absolutely necessary. (Yeah, Amazon search ""Zessica Wong"" You're welcome.). It's a must have for Aquarion fans. A nice to have but not top priority for SRC fans. Put it on the list to be gotten after you have churned through the Go Nagai's, the Sentai/Power Rangers and the Brave robots and are debating between this and whatever is left.

I would NOT recommended these. Such as shame, forget these 4+ star reviews look at the 1-2 star looks to be an issue with these lights.__________________________________________Two days in so far these seem to work OK. I would recommend them for price, but the color is much bluer than 6k for two other brands I have had on other vehicles. Because of this the light output is not as bright as the day breaker halogens it’s replacing in proper projectors. But because they are so cheap you can purchase the kit and a replacement set from them of their 5K blubs, as these 6K are closer to 7-8K color.  Longevity is something I cannot attest to as I haven’t had these but for 3 days and used for 2 days.Pros:The look is clean in the projectors.Nice fit on H1 socket.Comes with ballistic and bulbs for a plug and play solution.Price is under 40 dollars!Mounting hardware provided, and bulbs wrapped in plastic case for shipping.Cons:The light output is very blue, not a white blue as 6K is.The bulb is a little longer than other bulbs (H1).","R3AXXIU8KCBS5H",,,,,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","Died Fast","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AXXIU8KCBS5H/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08WRN3NSB","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",,,"amzn1.account.AHNJOQ6ZMVAPNBUGNRIXKODCWICA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHNJOQ6ZMVAPNBUGNRIXKODCWICA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: H1, Color: 6000k - Light Blue","B08WRN3NSB","Size","H1","Color","6000k - Light Blue",,

On the other end of the spectrum, I can't say enough good things about Ecobee. I spent about 45 minutes on the phone with their tech support who was excellent, answered all of my questions, had me send photos of my current wiring configuration and confirmed I needed a power block as well, explained clearly what wires needed to go where and then sent me a discount coupon too. I had complete confidence in self install and knew I could count on their technical support if needed (which I didn't).

I love that it also shows the humidity level in your house.There’s so many good things about this product, but what it comes down to is that it’s 100% worth the money.I haven’t had it long enough to know about money savings on my electricity bill but I think it’ll help a bit!","RLTN21MMG2374","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a9KUsmp5L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615pbM4iuQL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,"17 people found this helpful","100% worth the money!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLTN21MMG2374/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DT9MC2Z9","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHKJM6Y7A5E3QSKFQKUAGP3CAWDQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKJM6Y7A5E3QSKFQKUAGP3CAWDQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Style: New 2025 ecobee Smart Thermostat Essential - Energy Star Certified programmable Wi-Fi Thermostat - Works with Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant","B0DT9MC2Z9","Style","New 2025 ecobee Smart Thermostat Essential - Energy Star Certified programmable Wi-Fi Thermostat - Works with Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant",,,,

Well, it's a rudimentary hunk that fails at basic features.You would think that a ""smart"" thermostat that can already communicate with the internet and with your phone and with Ecobee headquarters can also communicate with other thermostats in the same house. Well, you would be wrong. For all its ""smarts"" this is a basic standalone device missing an obviously needed feature.You would also think that you could set different schedules for different seasons. Wrong again. You get ONE schedule, and you can customize it to death with temperature settings (but not with start times, see below) , but when you want to change from cooling season to heating season... You have to MANUALLY enter all the settings from scratch. And then do it again (from a piece of paper or something) when the seasons change. That is squarely in dumb territory, not even approaching smart.Oh, and you don't get the option to set the schedule you want. The app gives you 30-minute intervals. The video on the website misleadingly shows minutes, but there are no minute options on the schedule. On the instructional webpage is says ""If you wish to change the start time of a particular Activity, simply tap on the Activity (Home, Away, or Sleep) and adjust the time.""

The adjustment on the sides that set the flip down of the mask constantly adjust in my welding bag when move it around and need to be reset when I go to reuse the mask. The strap to set how far your head sits in the mask pops off easily as well, I taped it to my head height to stop that. And finally the mask is a little on the heavy side, probably due to the choice of batteries, which is great since they're easy to replace, but I don't find I need to replace my mask batteries anyways.All in all the few issues do not outweigh the performance of this mask, would buy again.","R1MD7I4RAZXAHF",,,,,,,,,,,,"Great mask",,"Reviewed in Canada on February 12, 2018",,,,,"Style: Arc Angel","B01HTMLPRI","Style","Arc Angel",,,,

Its definitely a great helmet but it  has some flaws, and I guess thats why its not at the same price level as a Speedglas.  Anyway, unless Im just super unlucky, the support sucks.  The site doesnt list this helmet under their product registration, so getting warranty is tough, to say the least.  The other issue is that there is a little gap between the helmet and the lens assembly.  When welding overhead, slag can get stuck in that gap and then you just end up smelling burning plastic for the rest of the day lol.  Not ideal but whatever.  The adjustment on the right side always gets loose, so I have to constantly tighten it.  Little things, but cant give it a 5.  Price was pretty good and it does work very well.

The fridge doesn't seem to be really stable so you might have to put something under it to keep it stable. Overall quality isn't great for the price.

I wasn't expecting this. Given the ""Linkbuds"" moniker I was expecting them to prioritize ambient sound features over all else, just like the original Linkbuds, but that simply isn't the case here.Build: the Linkbuds S are impossibly small compared to the WF-1000XM4, Sony's previous noise canceling earphones. They actually resemble the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 in overall size and shape. They also sport a nice large touch sensitive area that no one should have trouble missing. The only gripe I do have is that the outer surface is textured and this can cause some discomfort if it rubs against the crus helix.Case: the case is definitely one of the more pocketable out there. It's about the same size as the Airpods Pro case, but slightly shorter and narrower, albeit a bit thicker. However, it also has a textured surface which can make it a little difficult to slide in and out of pockets.Fit: the Linkbuds S fit very similar to the Galaxy Buds 2 and deeper than the WF-1000XM4. They are a little fiddly to fit. In my case I have to rotate them back and forth to get them to seat correctly. Although Sony instructs users to rotate the buds backwards to get a good fit I actually found this uncomfortable because the buds would rub against my Crus Helix and cause discomfort. Rotating them forward slightly fixed the issue. Once the buds were in place I found the fit to be secure and that, combined with their light weight, meant that it was easy to forget they were there. My one complaint about the fit is that the buds are so small that it's very difficult to insert them without either accidentally hitting the touch area or rubbing a finger against the noise canceling microphone, resulting in some static noise.Noise canceling: the noise canceling on the Linkbuds S is fantastic. Although the Linkbuds S are advertised as being open I actually found them to be more isolating than the WF-1000XM4s without noise canceling on. With noise canceling on I actually found the Linkbuds S to be slightly superior to the WF-1000XM4 in terms of blocking out background noise and they certainly blow the Galaxy Buds Pro/2 out of the water. I haven't had chance to test the Linkbuds S with very low frequency sounds (e.g. public transport, planes) but for blocking out office and household noise they're the best true wireless earphones I've tried.Sound: I saved the best to last. I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality of the Linkbuds S. The WF-1000XM4s were a big disappointment in this regard, with an overly dark presentation for my taste that led to recessed mids and lackluster treble. The Linkbuds S by comparison adopt a Harman-like tuning that presents mids and treble brilliantly with a satisfying bass boost that doesn't dominate the overall sound. The Linkbuds S definitely beat the WF-1000XM4s for overall sound and they're up there with the Galaxy Buds Pro/2, which are the reigning champs. Comparing the Galaxy Buds side by side with the Linkbuds S I honestly can't pick a favorite amongst the three, which I think is a very good thing.Other: in my limited tests the transparency features are great, as with the WF-1000XM4s. The only other thing that I think is worth noting is that the Linkbuds S struggle to maintain LDAC connectivity more than the WF-1000XM4s. This isn't surprising, given the small size, but is worth considering for anyone who wants to use LDAC in challenging environments or on the go.Wrap up: previously if I wanted to recommend a pair of true wireless earphones for someone I would have to include a 'but'. The Airpods Pro have great noise canceling but the sound isn't top tier and they don't play well with Android devices. The Galaxy Buds sound fantastic but the noise canceling isn't great and they don't play well with iOS. The WF-1000XM4s have top tier noise canceling and work well with both iOS and Android devices, but their sound isn't the best. The Linkbuds S on the other hand have top tier noise canceling, work excellent with both iOS and Android, and have excellent sound. These are now my default recommendation to anyone looking for new True Wireless earphones.Alternative picks: If it wasn't for the better Bluetooth connectivity of the WF-1000XM4s and the improved battery life the Linkbuds S would have made the XM4s redundant. Whether the increased price is worth it for those things will be up to the individual. I think there's still a case to be made for getting the cheaper Galaxy buds over the Linkbuds S if noise canceling isn't a priority. However, I think the only reason to pay more for the Airpods Pro would be if you really like the design and/or the enhanced integration with iOS is really important.","R11XKM5NH30ZUQ","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713GenO1mbL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TtFkp9qOL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,"274 people found this helpful","The best true wireless earphones for everyone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11XKM5NH30ZUQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YL296PM","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2022",,,"amzn1.account.AH6VAXGHQYGPVVIMRNEKENKN7ISQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6VAXGHQYGPVVIMRNEKENKN7ISQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Black","B09YL296PM","Color","Black",,,,

The charging life of these earbuds nose dive after about a year and a half of use! Don’t get me wrong, the earbuds sound really good, but the fact that after purchasing two different pairs of these earbuds, BOTH PAIRS had the same battery life / charging issues. After about a year and a half of use, the right earbud holds just enough of a charge to function for a little over an hour and then dies rather abruptly, while the left earbud still has well over half of its charge left.I tried calling Sony tech support, and as I am sure you can guess, though the support person I spoke with was kind and patient, their troubleshooting did nothing to restore the battery life of my earbuds. I was then told to call a third party repair service, which just directed me to a website to submit a repair.The SoundConnect app used to manage the earbud settings and features is clunky to use at the best of times, not to mention updating the firmware for the earbuds is a painfully slow and clunky process as well.If you have an iPhone, be prepared to deal with connectivity issues when taking phone calls - and problems with the app on the iPhone working in sync with the earbuds themselves.Because of the sound and lightweight quality of the earbuds, I wanted to love them. However, given the $200 price tag for obviously poorly constructed electronics, I CANNOT RECOMMEND THESE EARBUDS TO ANYONE, unless you want to just waste $200 of your hard earned money.Take it from someone who has owned two pairs of these earbuds and can confirm, no matter how well you take care of the Sony Linkbuds earbuds, they will stop holding a charge rendering them pretty much useless after about about a year and a half of use, the SoundConnect app is less than good, updating the earbuds firmware is extremely slow and drawn out, connectivity issues when taking a call gets old fast…and now I’m finding my earbuds case looks like it isn’t holding a charge as well. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere!!!UPDATE:The ""troubleshooting"" the Sony customer service rep walked me through did nothing to help with my Linkbuds issues. As a matter of fact, now they are barely holding a charge...no joke. At least before the troubleshooting I got a little use out of them before the charge would die.The site the Sony customer service rep referred me to that I mentioned in my original review was not set up to take repairs for the Sony Linkbuds S earbuds at all. The information on the repair site basically suggested I find a local electronics repair shop. So, I tried that. Not one business I called worked on the Sony earbuds - and I live in a large, tech-centric city.  That was a total bust and waste of my time.Then, through a random online search, I found a link to Sony webpage that directed me to call United Radio Service Inc. for repairs, so I did.  The person I spoke with told me that the cost for parts and repair labor made it infeasible to repair the earbuds due to the fact that the cost of the repairs would be more than the purchase cost of the earbuds. Another bust.Finally, I also found out that the earbuds and the USB transceiver are all pre-set with information that allows them to communicate with and from each other. These settings can only be configured at a Service Center with all components present. For this reason, you can't just simply replace one missing part yourself, i.e. a damaged earbud, say with one that you find refurbished online.Bottom line: You can't actually get the earbuds repaired, and you can't replace a defective earbud. No matter what line of nonsense Sony tries to tell you. Once these stop working properly outside the timeframe of the warranty, you are out of luck.***Again, Don't waste your money or time with these earbuds.  Look elsewhere, you'll be glad in the long run that you did!***","RZPWEDYKVRNZG",,,,,,,,,,,"18 people found this helpful","DO NOT BUY THE SONY LINKBUDS S EARBUDS!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZPWEDYKVRNZG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09YL296PM","Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEHMRZOSAORL3EOZSFWN754QRLSA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEHMRZOSAORL3EOZSFWN754QRLSA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Black","B09YL296PM","Color","Black",,,,

This comes very close to Sony's flagship tws, WF-1000XM4. The audio quality is mind blowing. The ANC is really good. You can say that it comes to about 90% of XM4's ANC capability. The battery life is decent but it doesn't matter to me much as I don't wear it continuously for more than 2 hrs and I put it back in the case after use. The comfort is great unlike the XM4 and you can wear it for a long time. It has a quick charge feature where a 5 min charge gives you 60 mins of playback. As mentioned by another reviewer, don't use the Equalizer in the Sony Headphones app. Install the Wavelet app and use its auto equalizer for Linkbuds S. The difference in quality is huge. Another useful feature is that you can connect to 2 devices at the same time.Do note that the right earbud is the primary unit and it consumes more power than the left one. There will be a slight difference in the battery to about 2 to 6% between both the earbuds. If you see a huge difference to about 12 to 20% or more, one of the earbuds is defective and you need to get it replaced.The only drawback I felt in this device is that during phone calls, the voice sounds mechanical and not natural. When I called my friend via the earbuds, he immediately asked me if I'm using some earphones or headphones as the clarity wasn't great. So if you are buying this device for calls, I will not recommend it. You can look at other premium devices like Samsung Buds 2 Pro, Airpods Pro 2, Bose QC 2, Oppo Enco X2 and the OnePlus Buds Pro 2. The latest Sony flagship, WF-1000XM5, is the best version of the XM4 and the Linkbuds S as it has incorporated all the positives from both devices. If you have the budget, then definitely go for the XM5.","R26IB46620XGMO",,,,,,,,,,,,"Excellent earbuds for audiophiles!",,"Reviewed in India on November 1, 2023",,,,,"Color: Black","B09YL296PM","Color","Black",,,,

Good quality and easy to use. However, there's a whole app and a ton of features you might not use, making the price tag a little less worth it for you.I absolutely recommend these earbuds if you have small ears like me. I've never had earbuds that (even with the tiniest buds) don't hurt my ears or gradually slip and fall out due to how small my ears are. These are the first earbuds I've ever had that fit like a glove and are comfortable for hours on end. You can tell how well they fit in the pictures I attached. Swear to God, doctors should prescribe you these earbuds if they notice your ears are tiny lol.It's also awesome how low profile they are. Check out the attached picture for how little it sticks out from my ear. It's perfect if you like a lowkey style or if you like to lay on your side and listen to stuff. I can sleep on my side with both earbuds in for a good hour or two, which I really appreciate.I also appreciate their ease of use. Pairing them to a device is simple; just press a button on the back of the case. I also like all the touch controls, e.g. tap once on the left to switch from noise cancelling to ambient, tap 4x on the right to raise volume, etc. They work well while also not being oversensitive. Your music won't pause just because your hat or hair hit your ear, which is great.As far as quality goes, they're about what I'd expect for this price range. The sound quality is good and I like the different equalizer settings. I really like how it'll give you a little test and create an equalizer profile fit to your music taste. The noise cancelling is good enough and the ambient mode works well too. Lastly, the quality of the earbuds themselves is good. I didn't get the recycled plastic ones, but mine feel like good quality plastic.My sole complaint is that I feel like the value for money is off a bit if you don't care about the extra software. If you don't want to install the app that goes with the earbuds and set up the extra features, it feels like a bit of a waste.For example, there's this whole adaptive noise cancelling feature that will automatically adjust when (and how much?) noise is cancelled based on what you're doing and where you are. I haven't used this feature at all. Firstly, because it takes a set up process in a quiet place, which I never got around to doing. Secondly, it requires precise location data to be on and accessed at all times. Call me a boomer, but I don't think my earbuds need to or should know which cafés I frequent or what my schedule is like. It's a lot of work when it's already so easy to just manually switch them from noise cancelling to ambient when someone talks to you.It also supports 360° Dolby atmos sound, which is cooler in theory than in practice. Very few music streaming platforms support this sound. Tidal was the only one I recognized, and it seems like it's dropping the service soon. I can't help but wonder if the price could have been lower if it didn't have this feature that most customers won't use.Other people might feel the same about the equalizer settings or the ability to test and find the best fit for your ears. Anyway, if you don't care about these extra features, there might be a cheaper, simpler option for you.Either way, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I've had them for 6 months now and although the $200 price tag wasn't easy for me, I never regret my decision. I'll probably keep buying these until they stop making them lol.","R291B8J159HHJE",,,,,,,,,,,,"Awesome for Small Ears, Good Otherwise",,"Reviewed in Canada on January 24, 2025",,,,,"Color: White","B09YL296PM","Color","White",,,,

But amazon is providing replacement not return. I regret the purchase. I would have gone for airpodsEdit: 5-7-2024After few updates and formatting now its working fine.

Then the earbuds would not turn on when i opened the case, unless the case was plugged in. I ended up getting a replacement pair, and so far so good. but I called customer support because i couldn't figure out how to remove the old profile from the JBL app. I couldn't find anything online about it. Customer service is clearly offshored. So the rep was hard to understand, and she couldn't understand me well either it seemed as if she had to constantly ask me to repeat the intake questions, which were pretty detailed, like what, when, where did you order from, what is the problem (asked 3 times), give me 3 forms of contact information, at which point, after about 10 minutes of intake, and still asking more demographic questions, all while being able to clearly hear what sounded like a party in the background, I asked her how much more information she'd need before we could get to the stated question, she hung up on me. I've worked customer support before and can understand how stressful the job can be.

So far, I've had a 40 minute chat support that did not result in the earbuds passing the second step of setup, getting the right seal.While I managed to pair the earbuds with my iPad, I am thus far unable to pair them with my MacBook.The iPad app told me that the seal in the ear was not good, but provided no instruction on how to fix the problem. Should I use the larger or smaller provided rubber things?There are no markings on the earbuds that indicate left versus right ear that I am able to find.  But apparently it is important to know which is officially which because controls are on the side.  It took repeated questioning in the chat to finally be told the one that sits in the left side of the case is the left item.After ending the chat and struggling to get past the size setup, I failed to move beyond step three.  The app kept saying be in a noisy place with no instructions or feedback on how to find a noisy place.The FAQs within the app provides no guidance on how to actually control the volume.  Either the default volume is much to high, or I've managed to maximize it.The provided user manual is a picture book with fewer details than an Ikea piece of furniture.I have been unable to find official videos to resolve any of my questions.  I am entirely dependent upon finding videos from independent resources about various topics and often having to hope that similar JBL products function the same way.I will say using the iPad app installing a software update onto the earbuds was easy.  The app provided good information about the estimated time to install and then the time remaining.  This is why I gave two  stars rather than one.In short, unless you are a millennial, I would not recommend this product.I am unable to actually review the capabilities of the product.  Until I can figure out how to control the volume, it is worthless.  I have not attempted to use the product to conduct a phone call, listen to a podcast, exercise or swim, or any of the other basic functions I had hoped for.  I am also unable to provide star ratings for noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life.","RPFE0414XJK6N",,,,,,,,,,,"3 people found this helpful","Difficult to Setup","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPFE0414XJK6N/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3LZ8VRL","Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AEWK5UPND7ZMSP2PQOMAVJSVO7TQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWK5UPND7ZMSP2PQOMAVJSVO7TQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Black","B0B3LZ8VRL","Color","Black",,,,

This means you won't have to fight the stiffness of the hose while trying to hold or position the air tool. Once you have these, you'll wonder how you got along without them. I've installed them on almost all of my air tools.Make sure when you order these swivels that you order the correct size for your tool. They come in 1/4"", 3/8"" and 1/2"" NPT. These sizes refer to the inside diameter of the fitting. The most common size on hardware store air tools is 1/4"". The larger sizes are found on tools requiring substantial airflow to operate properly like large grinders.Also make sure if you have a high-flow air tool that you aren't using the tiny quick-connect fittings that seem to be the default on most hardware store air tools. These fittings have only a 1/4"" air passage and will restrict the airflow and performance of a high-flow tool. You should also be using a minimum of 3/8"" ID hose (1/2"" would be better) with the bigger tools if you want the performance you paid for. I use the 3/8"" (P-Style) quick connectors on all my air tools and I use 1/2"" hoses for most applications.Note that there are knock-offs of these connectors made by Dyna-Flo and some no-name manufacturers. While Dyna is a quality manufacturer of air tools, their swivel connectors are made of plastic and won't last as long as the Milton brand which are machined from billet aluminum. The others fail and start leaking at the seals in even light-duty use. I'm replacing them all with Milton brand when they fail. Buy the Milton's and you'll be happier in the long run.","R3ACX10UK9RH1Z",,,,,,,,,,,"14 people found this helpful","You'll want these on all your air tools!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ACX10UK9RH1Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CONUIS","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2009",,,"amzn1.account.AGIJ3C2I5WUTPCUYFORJMKJ6XONA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGIJ3C2I5WUTPCUYFORJMKJ6XONA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B000CONUIS",,,,,,

Price of the product with a 12 month extension now waves the $50 cost of the upgrade from the 4.0.  I had an existing 6-7 months on my membership.I'm hoping member out-lash will help the company focus more on customer satisfaction (customer service) over hard/rigid pricing. Another problem with the pricing side of the device is the hard push on the subscription model and locking customers in with no flexibility. This doesn't build customer/consumer loyalty/confidence. The device itself, and software are great products. Unfortunately, I will have to order more straps since the 4.0 ones will not fit the 5.0I expressed my disappointment to Whoop and CS offset the $50 up-charge in ""good faith"" by giving me a credit towards accessories/clothing in my Whoop account. I appreciated that as it was unexpected. It took them about 24hrs to respond to me through Faceb00k. Loyal customers want a considerate/loyal/thoughtful company that allows them to feel supported when issues/concerns arise... It causes hesitation for people to enter into the ecosystem/community. Word of mouth goes a long way for when it comes to having a positive experience with a company that requires an extensive and expensive financial commitment. I appreciate the timely communication and them offering something back due to the concerns I expressed. I also own an Oura ring and their CS has been amazing valuing existing and foreseeable members.I am an existing Whoop 4.0 member. I've had the product for around a year in a half. Purchasing my Whoop through Amazon was pretty seamless. I opted for Amazon due to unknown shipping times through Whoop's website, spotty customer service at times, and a building resentment that I may not stay a member because of how they treat customers. Also, the return policy with Amazon had I had any further issues with the Company.When I paired the 5.0 to the whoop app on my phone the membership time was automatically increased 12 months and the new module paired seamlessly. I got a notification through the app after pairing the 5.0 that my 12 months was added to my remaining membership time of 6 months. I was concerned that being an existing member I may not be able to purchase the device through Amazon... For those already members, I assume you shouldn't have any issues either.In summary, I did not pay any extra for the updated device. I did pay for an additional 12 months, which I had not planned for initially due to Whoop going back on their word. Seems like they are responding positively to upset customers such as myself. I received the Whoop 5.0 next day shipping without issue from Amazon.5/25/25Changed my rating from 4/5 stars to 3/5. Again, product works well overall, but the business practices are extremely questionable. They recently updated their “terms of use” and “privacy policy” to cover up their dishonesty and abusive management/sales tactics. It’s so sad to have a great product marred by terrible management/marketing. I’m considering leaving the company, returning the product, sending back everything (straps and charger) I got for the product.

When I went to  Pinnacle website there was only the option to buy the software but no option  to download it after purchasing it from Amazon. I then contacted Amazon customer service three times via chat to get instructions on how to download the software. They were unable to provide step by step instructions . I was given an Amazon links but it did not resolve the issue.I then went online to find out what the process was .  I found instructions on the Amazon website which stated to go to my orders , find the software purchased and  there should be a download option next to the order . Tried this but could not find any download option next to the order . I even looked in the digital downloads section and software library but still could not find this purchase.

I scan all the correspondence and bills that come into my home, as well as recording purchases, using a succession of 'print screen' saves onto a text file at each stage of the buying process, then saving the whole record as pdf file, with a chronological ID No.  This software will allow me to open an existing pdf file and modify it, then save it again.  Also, it will allow me to attach a 'no modifications' password to one of my documents, to prevent it being modified by the recipient of the file in an E-mail.It is an invaluable tool.I am back in charge of my computing requirements.  It is a good feeling to have.","R1E0MYQ4KFUF09",,,,,,,,,,,,"It is an invaluable tool.

Leider war die Videokamera nach 10 Jahren defekt. Die Filme konnte ich davor noch nicht von Kassette auf PC überspielen. Aus dem Grund war es in den letzten 15 Jahren nicht möglich, die Filme anzuschauen. Mittlerweile gibt es die Möglichkeit, Videokassetten digitalisieren zu lassen. Auf diese Art erhielt ich nach langer Zeit die alten Filme als Datei zurück. Alle digitalisierten Filme hatten die volle Kassettenlänge, auch wenn die Kassetten damals zum Teil nicht vollständig bespielt waren. Somit waren die Dateien teilweise viel zu groß.Als Nutzer von Windows 10 suchte ich ein einfaches, preiswertes Programm zur Filmbearbeitung, was nicht ganz einfach war. Am Ende habe ich mich für VideoConverter Ultimate entschieden. Hiermit lassen sich zahlreiche Film-Datei-Formate bearbeiten.Die Verwendung ist recht einfach. Ich bin kein großer Filmspezialist, aber selbst für mich war es problemlos möglich, meine Dateien anzupassen. Am Ende der Filme vorhandene, unbespielte Abschnitte der Originalkassetten habe ich entfernt. So kürzt sich die Filmlänge auf Originaldauer und die Dateigröße reduziert sich entsprechend. Einige der letzten Filmaufnahmen zeigten bereits Fehler durch die damals beginnenden Mängel der Videokamera. Mittels Einstellungen des Programms lassen sich Farben und Kontrast anpassen sowie Rauschen am Filmrand korrigieren. Dadurch sehen die Filme deutlich besser aus. Das Datei-Format lässt sich u.a. von AVI in mp4 ändern. Die Dateigröße eines 90 Min.-Films ließ sich so von 4 GB auf unter 2 GB reduzieren. Trotzdem sah die Qualität auf dem PC-Monitor und dem 40""-TV unverändert gut aus. Aus Filmdateien lassen sich mit dem Programm kleine Szenen ausschneiden, d.h. ein großer Film wird zu einem ganz kurzen Abschnitt reduziert und dieser gespeichert. Damit konnte ich an die Familie per WhatsApp kleine Grüße aus der alten Zeit schicken.VideoConverter ist ein einfaches Programm, dass mir als Hobby-Filmer bei der Filmbearbeitung problemlos unter die Arme greift.","R295S9GHQLDJ49",,,,,,,,,,,,"Greift dem Hobby-Filmer bei der Filmbearbeitung problemlos unter die Arme",,"Reviewed in Germany on March 16, 2017",,,,,"","3959828101",,,,,,

Die Software sagt beim Start, dass es ein Update gibt, wenn man darauf klickt, werden Dateien heruntergeladen und installiert, am Schluss heißt es dann man, man solle das Programm beenden, damit die Updates installiert werden können, macht man das, ist ALLES beendet. Und beim nächsten Start wird man wieder darauf hingewiesen: ""Es gibt ein Update...""

It gave an unresolved error message, repeatedly. Then I requested Webroot Support to remove the 30-day Trial Version on the LastPass Password Manager anyhow, because I wanted my new subscriptions all to renew at the same time next year. Also, trial versions often do not include all the paid version features; I believed a 1-Year subscription to Lastpass Premium was included in my purchase of Webroot Premium and I did not want to wait to get what I had purchased. The Webroot Support could not remove the Trial Version status, so they sent me to the Lastpass Support, which was the WORST support I ever had.The LastPass Support delayed answering for days, and until my second request, as I waited to set up my passwords. Then after a few  useless, back and forth communications, from their Support Portal on their website, they instructed me to answer all questions and send proof of purchase in an email they sent me. Questions: ""How many password records should we expect to see in your account?"" (Answer: 0) and ""What year and month would be the date of the oldest entry in your account?"" Ugh. Then, NO REPLY to that! The website portal kept saying, ""Waiting for customer's reply."" Their Support Portal and Email communications are not connected. I went to their website portal and told them I sent the email, but still no answer.I fully understand the reasonable, nonreturnable policies on software subscriptions, but in my opinion, this was a defective product and it was falsely advertised. The Amazon Service Rep said they would make this a special case and refund the Webroot Premium I purchased.Then afterward, I received an email from Lastpass, saying my trial period had ended, with a link to their shopping cart to purchase the Premium version. I had suspected that the reason the Lastpass Support kept stalling was that after 30 day, surprise! I was going to have to pay for the 1-Year subscription, that I believed came with the Webroot Premium subscription.

His boss' daughter Jenny Garcia (Ariana Rivas), is kidnapped, and he uses his skills to try to track her.This reunites Jason Statham and director David Ayer from the Beekeeper. One's surprised they just didn't do a sequel given its success and considering how similar Statham's character and the basic plot of a man avenging a wrong against a good person is, but apparently Sylvester Stallone (who also co-wrote) brought the script to Statham, and he brought the script to Ayer. Though I'd say Beekeeper was the superior film as it was more willing to go over-the-top, this film is a pretty solid follow-up.The action gets violent and crazy; the final fight is delightfully insane and memorable. Like Beekeeper, you've got a ton of distinctive baddies (played by a pretty solid bunch of actors, including League of Extraordinary Gentlemen/Pennyworth's Jason Flemying, who I'm surprised isn't better known. He's good in whatever he's done.)There are also some unique outfits and hideout designs in here. It can be a little weird seeing Cade walk amongst regular people and architecture only to walk into someone wearing brightly colored outfit in an eccentric looking-chari, but I wouldn't call that a deal breaker.The setup is a little wooden (though not slow, the movie speeds right through). The exposition about Cade's life doesn't feel natural. Plus, he's got a custody battle subplot that is supposed to help endear the character, but it feels forced and the daughter (The Outlaw's Isla Gie) and the former father-in-law (sorry, couldn't figure which actor was him) he's having the custody fight with don't sound like real people. However, once the movie gets to the action, that's when everything comes into place and things get going.Statham is again great as the tough guy who is determined and mows down everyone in his way, though he can't sell some of the poorly written dialogue moments. Michael Pena is good in his limited screen time as the emotionally distressed father of Jenny.Recommended. If you loved the Beekeeper, like I said, it won't be exactly it, but it'll probably wet your whistle. (Just walk into this knowing that A Working Man takes itself slightly more serious than the Beekeeper.)","R2MP03WM3HXF23",,,,,,,,,,,"6 people found this helpful","Crazy, fun time","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MP03WM3HXF23/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F1ZFK1MB","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEECFYRSDPYS4WNWXWOX3T46LRXA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEECFYRSDPYS4WNWXWOX3T46LRXA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F1ZFK1MB",,,,,,
