It has a lot of action, stunt work and seemingly advanced technology written into it but the director and writers Jillian Jacobs and Chris Roach did not give real thought to the reasoning and quick oversimplification of how closed-circuit camera’s work, how they can be taken over and/or manipulated over cell phones. I don’t think even the CIA equipment is this sophisticated.The story is that of Violet (Meghann Fahy), a widowed mother who goes to an upscale restaurant to meet Henry (Brandon Sklenar), a charming and handsome date. However, her pleasant evening soon turns into a living nightmare when she receives phone messages/texts from a mysterious, hooded figure who threatens to kill her young son and sister unless she kills Henry. The baddie (played by Reed Diamond) and her sister (Violett Beane) both play key roles in the unfolding drama, with weird twists and lots of action.The film has a very sharp, deep and color pallet thanks to the cinematography by Marc Spicer and the editing by Ben Baudhuin with all the action and the stunts is really done well. The music is by Bear McCreary who, as I am familiar with his work, he does another great job helping the mood and tension up and downs of the film.It’s a fun little ‘science fiction’ film (written sarcastically) that looks good and is smooth with its sleek style, just forget reality all together and you’ll enjoy the action, special effects and stunts.

Can someone tell me why its called “Drop”?Lorenzo M","R2A0V73IX5GCDX","One person found this helpful","Not At All Original, Very Predictable And No Reality To Be Found - A Fun “Fantasy”","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A0V73IX5GCDX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F3G18CGG","Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFKAHC57K3RYJZVNN7JASNYPURUQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKAHC57K3RYJZVNN7JASNYPURUQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F3G18CGG",,,,

The UI looks mainly the same but with some added niceties (i.e. there is Dark mode in the newer versions). I am still not happy about the object manager docker as it's always felt clunky and difficult to manage layers and objects. Definitely some improvements with the tools themselves but again they are mainly evolutionary. I am not interested in the ""connected"" features.CorelDraw X7 is officially certified to work in Windows 10 so I saw no reason to upgrade that. I also have the latest updates from the Corel website for it.Unfortunately, my main issues here are with the licensing system. As mentioned I own a boxed copy of CorelDraw X7. Some time ago Corel completely killed the activation servers for it (and many other old versions of Corel software). You can install and plug in the key (and the key shows up in your Corel account as authenticated), but the software itself won't activate. Corel had deferred the activation process to a 3rd party system called ""ntitles"" which has since ceased to exist. You really cannot use the old versions anymore due to activation servers being down.I contacted the Corel customer support and the main response was basically ""we don't support installations of older versions of CorelDraw, and here is a small discount for the latest version"". I don't want to be forced to drop half a grand to upgrade because the activation servers are down. I would want to activate if there are new features I need/want. So instead of releasing a small update to use the Corel activation server instead of ""ntitles"" they instead just try to get you to buy the latest version.So even if you were to buy CorelDraw 2025 it's unknown how long it will work before it becomes unusable due to missing activation support. I just cannot recommend such business model. To me that makes the software unreliable for long term use and I can't trust that my original .cdr files will be usable going forward.I have finally decided to leave CorelDraw and migrate to Affinity suite. Looks much more modern, is cheaper, has perpetual licensing, and there are versions of Affinity older than CorelDraw X7 that are still working just fine.","RJKI8H4Z0ATP2","3 people found this helpful","Not really perpetual license","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJKI8H4Z0ATP2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DXQDR1W2","Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFNHHONCFX7PZ4M5CKXWDJXJWPFQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNHHONCFX7PZ4M5CKXWDJXJWPFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Platform For Display: PC/Mac Download, Edition: Graphics Suite","B0DXQDR1W2","Platform For Display","PC/Mac Download","Edition","Graphics Suite"

The single-player missions include some tutorials that introduce the game's content, notably how to defeat the various enemies, use your weapons, and satisfy your objectives so you can exit.You play as Jake, a human, or Garathe Den, an 8-foot horned beast with serious muscle. Besides your fists, there are grenades and ninja stars; both are devastating weapons because you can throw 2-3 per second, enough to win most battles.Jake gets a weak pistol. It's not powerful, but certain enemies like mine generators and chamelons (moneky-ish things that can turn near-invisible) are pistol fodder. He has a shotgun that proves itself useful in most battles, and his most powerful weapon, the rocket launcher. Believe me, once you have that tube and 99 rockets, nothing's going to stand in your way for long.Garathe has knives; they fly in a straight line and do some damage, and if they get stuck in a wall you can run and pull 'em out. He gets a mash-them-up! club that sends enemies flying and some serious damage. He even gets a whip that throws plasma bolts; they knock most anything to the ground.There's multi-player levels, and you can choose to play as Garathe or Jake, along with (shirt for Jake, fur color for Garathe) red, brown, black, and white colors--heck, you can be the same character for grins. In these MP levels, you and a friend get to fight it out in one of 20 levels and compete for the most kills; most of these levels are designed just for two humans to fight it out, but there are a few with significant enemies or hazards if you want a challenge.The co-op levels (15 altogether) are a lot of fun except for the one called ""The Blue One."" You don't choose your character, but it's a SP mission on steroids and like in the SP missions, you have to complete an objective or two, then find the exit to complete the level.The gameplay is very straightforward, like any arcade game, and even slow learners should have a good grasp of it after only a few hours of playing. The game doesn't hog system resources either, so its graphics (1990s era) look great, and the sound effects like Garathe's grunting as he climbs ladders are realistic-sounding.I don't recommend listening to the heavy metal and techno soundtracks on the CD, because they might be disturbing to some young listeners, but the game doesn't require its CD to run, so you can insert your own music and run it from the in-game drop-down menu.This came out before internet gameplay, so there's no way to play this online, but with the sheer number of levels for SP, MP, and co-op, you won't be begging for it anytime soon.Overall, this game is one of the most original, fun, and dark I ever played. I highly recommend it.","ROLCGHWHBZUJR","2 people found this helpful","Ah, the Old Days....","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROLCGHWHBZUJR/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002YLAD0","Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2011",,,"amzn1.account.AG3HIH6YAUM7T34MHJB4WY67IACQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3HIH6YAUM7T34MHJB4WY67IACQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0002YLAD0",,,,

I am not a big grammer person but I think it's important so you can figure it out in real conversation.  After you ""pass"" the first CD of memorization then you go onto the next totally different learning style CD (like it's a different language program).  Some of the memorization from this CD doesn't follow the memorization from the 1st CD (doesn't use ""the"" in front of the word has different names for the same word etc.).  The 3rd CD is even worse...it gives you phrases (some of them totally useless) that you have to memorize and try to spit back.  Again, no grammer cues as to how to put a sentance together.  Maybe a toddler learns this way (over a 2-5 year period) but as an adult learner I was hoping to learn a little better for my trip to Rome.  I am not going to use the phrase ""can you heat up this jar of babyfood""!  There is no cohesion between the CDs and there is no real learning.  I gave up after seeing the 5th CD and I couldn't understand a darn thing...it went from memorization to ""immersion""-no spoken English...and they sure in the heck weren't speaking the phrases I had memorized!","R1AFTS39478U6Y","26 people found this helpful","only if you have a good memory","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AFTS39478U6Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026PI8QA","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2009",,,"amzn1.account.AHZS5QLZP7CIJEHC4KEMT75CIACQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZS5QLZP7CIJEHC4KEMT75CIACQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0026PI8QA",,,,

One of the reasons I bought this product was so I could install it in my work, home, and notebook computers (something Rosetta Stone doesn't allow), but since it executes from CD ROM, it's not going to useful on my optical drive-less notebook, and it's going to run slower on the desktops than a program run from the hard disk.But even setting aside the annoyance factors, I just don't like the way it allegedly teaches.  It presents several groups of words, and says the goal is to get 1800 points.

This product compares to Rosetta Stone in the way that a fast food hamburger compares to a well-prepared steak.  This is really nothing more than a mildly-interactive vocabulary list.  Perhaps that's worth the money, but don't confuse it with the advanced learning procedures from Rosetta Stone.  My problem with RS is that they do not show you enough direct translation vocabulary.  So in that sense, this would be a nice complement to RS.  The audio CD's included in this are actual lessons, thus not really helpful for drilling and memorizing.  It's really not comparable to RS at all, and any comparison is incredibly unfair.  They should take those claims off of their packaging.

The graphics are low-resolution and the general feel is dated, but that is no problem for a 90-year-old! Other reviewers report that the disk must be in the optical disk drive for the game to work. I did not verify that. To avoid that inconvenience, I used public-domain software (WinCDEmu) to make an .iso file version of the disk and to mount the .iso file; I then ejected the physical disk and installed the  from that mounted ""virtual optical disk"". The games work fine without the physical disk in the optical drive (on a Windows 7 PC), including after rebooting. In reading the disk to make the .iso file, the software found many bad sectors on the disk, which might be part of the copy-protection scheme that requires the disk in the drive. But installing from the resulting .iso file worked anyway, and the few games and features that I have tested so far have all worked as intended.

Over the years, I think we have had every single version.  Some of the versions have taken a little getting used to, so I was prepared for an adjustment period.The 2009 version is dreadful.  It's awful, a travesty.  I am shocked and dismayed to even find the good name of Hoyle attached to such a lackluster and disappointing product.I know it's petty and silly, but I miss the little lizard. He's been gone for a couple of versions and I was hoping he would be back.  I miss the weiner-dog too.  With all the technology and the space available on a DVD, you would think they could maybe add in some of the old characters or maybe some new ones.  These appear to be the exact same ones that have been available in 2008 (and 2007).The whole 'purchase scenery and card pieces' idea...eh.  It's ok.  I don't like or dislike it, necessarily.  I don't see the point or know why they bothered.The cards are STILL too small. [Note, there was some kind of patch from last November that apparently increased the size of the cards, they are STILL too small]The ""Card Speed"" in the Environment settings is a joke.  It appears to be a slider bar (much like an X-axis on a graph) with major and minor tick marks.  But you can't adjust to a minor tick mark.  The second to the fastest major tick mark is sloooooow (and my computer is running Vista on a 2.8 GHz processor with 8 GB of RAM) and the all the way fastest tick mark is so fast you can't even see cards move...you just hear the flips in the background.  I'm even afraid to try any slower setting, I don't have years to watch the cards move.Cards are selected by a scrolly list at the bottom which doesn't work well and which the spouse says 'is sea-sickening.'Scores are no longer reported on the game field.  WHAT?  Yes, you read correctly.  While playing a game you can now only see your score between hands.You now only have two choices for sorting (ascending and descending).  Depending on the game I am playing this makes things difficult.  While playing Gin, I don't use simple ascending, I group by pairs, sets or runs...but I can't do that in Hoyle 2009.  I don't have the option of a custom sort or even unsorted.They tried to be fancy and create ""rooms"" you can play cards in.  There is scenery, background and a table you all sit around.  The problem is that most of the games have a 45 degree angle on the table, which makes the entire playing surface difficult to see, fuzzy and tiny.  I was perfectly happy with the older versions where the cards just kind of sat on the borders of the screen.  It worked very well and was functional.  Why fix what isn't broken?The interface has been changed and very much not for the better.  All right click functionality is gone.  In some games (like Canasta) you have to left-click a card and drag it to the appropriate spot on the table, which is fuzzy, difficult to see and (in many cases) BLOCKED by the card you are dragging.Some of the AIs seem to be more intelligent.  The bridge AI does seem to have some improvement over previous versions and the spades AI doesn't seem to trump my aces like the older versions.However, even with a slight improvement in AI, the interface is so awful that the game is nearly unplayable.  If I could return the game, I would.  Instead, I'm probably going to reinstall the old version (2008, iirc) and see if maybe I can't sell 2009 on eBay.Oh, I thought I might write Encore an email and tell them about the problems I had with the game...but there doesn't appear to be any way to contact them directly (from the info on their website) except by snailmail.  That seems rather odd to me (and rather fishy) for a company that is making computer games.  I can't help but think it's done on purpose.They seem to have some link with Broderbund (from PrintShop fame).  Considering their lack of technical support, a [purposeful] inability to contact the company and an extremely poor quality of product, I believe that unless something amazing happens in the near future I will not purchase any other product from Encore (or Broderbund).Hoyle Card Games 2009 is that bad.  It's so bad I'm going to avoid the manufacturer and their other products.  Take it to heart and RUN, do not walk away from this game...buy 2007 or 2008 instead.  You will be MUCH happier.","R3F7FXCZAHQ3N3","15 people found this helpful","RUN, don't walk away from Hoyle Card Games 2009","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F7FXCZAHQ3N3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B5FH9M","Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2009",,,"amzn1.account.AGJ2OREBLVMGHK4ILG7U27M6G77Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJ2OREBLVMGHK4ILG7U27M6G77Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B001B5FH9M",,,,

The dialogue is hysterical. It plays like a very bad Tele-Novella complete with static and stoic lines, cliché’s of close-up and forced relationships. It was so bad it was not only boring, but funny to watch. And not in the good way.Starring Dave Bautista and Milla Jovovich (both a VERY big yawn) the film has no meat, no real original purpose. I think it is trying to be a weirdly produced, but bad copy of a “Mad Max” -like movie – without an original story, characters or point to the society created in this world. The film is gritty and completely looks CG’d throughout by cinematographer Glen MacPherson and faded cuts and wipes from editor Niven Howie don’t help the dull pace. A very artificial looking and feeling film.

So.If you have an older computer, the games are great fun - or at least, I remember them being so - but given that every computer I have access to is Windows 7 or 8, I'm pretty much out of luck here.","R3ITC2L9EH22U","2 people found this helpful","WARNING","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ITC2L9EH22U/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000063LGK","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2013",,,"amzn1.account.AE4GWBSICNP4SWJIWBEJ5KDLXRCA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE4GWBSICNP4SWJIWBEJ5KDLXRCA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B000063LGK",,,,

The idea is you are given a set of items and a limited amount of funds and you have to use those limitations to try and, not only survive the race, but also make it through the rough areas of Africa itself. Your strength, stamina, and how well you manage your resources are all going to be considered and tested, throughout the game. This game is deal for people who want to learn about the ways to survive in a bike race through Africa and is great for all ages.Something you should know is that, this game was designed to run under Windows 3.1/95/98/XP. This game will not run on Windows Vista/7/8 as the game is too old for todays technology. Also, because the game is so old, tech support is no longer in service and is no longer considered due to the age of the game itself. So, the only way this game will work is if you still have a working copy of Windows 3.1-XP, otherwise you are just wasting your money.

Make sure you set the software to run at 640x480 resolution (in the shortcut properties in Windows XP).
