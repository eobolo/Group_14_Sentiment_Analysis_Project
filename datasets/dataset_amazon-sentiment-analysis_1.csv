I did take into account that the shirts are all 90% to 100% cotton and ordered one size larger for shrinkage( I wear a Men's Large so I ordered and Extra Large. I washed the shirts in warm water and dried in the dryer on low removing them immediately to hangers to prevent wrinkles. The shirts did indeed shrink, just about 1/2 size but I expect that they will shrink a little more over time so they should fit perfect after one more washing. They seem well made with all seams intact and no loose threads, the Black didn't fade like some reviews said and they shrank more in length than in width but the shirts have extra long tails so that isn't an issue for me. Over all this bundle of shirts is a great deal, 5 quality shirts for $20 where else are you going to find a deal like that these days. I recommend these Gildan T-shirts in this bundle, overall great shirts, Great value.","R1IIUQ3T9SQ0MN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11 people found this helpful","Great Summer Tee's, good value, good quality, good vendor, what's not to like?","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IIUQ3T9SQ0MN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077ZMKWVM","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHDAM3GGP46ANARWKME3X47JGFFA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDAM3GGP46ANARWKME3X47JGFFA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Number of Items: 5, Color: Black/Sport Grey/Military Green (5-pack), Size: X-Large","B077ZMKWVM","Number of Items","5","Color","Black/Sport Grey/Military Green (5-pack)","Size","X-Large"

There is such a difference in shrinkage depending on whether the shirt is SOLID color or HEATHERED.  I have only known GILDAN brand t-shirts that were 100% cotton. When I looked at description of material, I saw the first shirt listed was 100% cotton and didn’t think to look further.  I did not realize that the colored t-shirt sets have different % cotton.  Therefore when washed, some will shrink a full size easily and others will slightly shrink and others will shrink some but not enough to be considered a full size smaller depending on the % blend of polyester.  SO BUYER BEWARE AND READ % cotton for each color! Who knew ?!?  The 100% cotton ones are nice and durable while the blends tend to be lighter fabric.  Thankfully, I don’t mind sleeping in t-shirts that are too large so I get to keep the ones that have not shrunk enough to fit my husband properly.  We purchased L to account for shrinkage when dried on Medium or High heat.  My husband wears M so the shirts with the poly blend are mine and he has the rest.  It’s a shame the seller does NOT IDENTIFY the material discrepancy upfront—better yet, sell the t-shirts per material content and not mixed.  GILDAN is a nice brand and the 100% cotton have always been a favorite so I tossed the shirts in the wash immediately when received.  Not realizing the material differences when I washed them, I will now get to learn what the poly blends are like but I am guessing I will always prefer the 100% cotton.  I would have given 5-stars if seller would have been up front with the varied material for the colored sets.  Honestly, we are a bit disappointed to discover the material difference in the sets AFTER THE FACT.  Hope this helps anyone wondering about why such mixed reviews for size and material.","R2DGCK25VAZELL",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"51 people found this helpful","Nice shirts but BUYER BEWARE and 👀 read % cotton per color of shirt 👀 …","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DGCK25VAZELL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077ZMKWVM","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFHKQMLUHBQHXO4SOMWZD65G5XBQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFHKQMLUHBQHXO4SOMWZD65G5XBQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Number of Items: 5, Color: Navy/Heather Navy/Indigo Blue (5-pack), Size: Large","B077ZMKWVM","Number of Items","5","Color","Navy/Heather Navy/Indigo Blue (5-pack)","Size","Large"

I’ve never in my life had a pair of nipples stickies that have performed so well. They truly stick until you take them off at the end of the night, even it hot and humid weather (I live in FL). They are seamless under the most thin fabrics, they don’t irritate my skin at all, and they are very comfortable to wear.Some points to consider-I’m a B cup and I ended up getting the size 2 covers (for larger breasts) because I felt like the smaller size left a little bit of an indent under my shirts so you could see the edges more easily. The bigger size took care of that!After about a year the stickiness around the edges is starting to wear off. Not so badly that I cannot wear them anymore, but unless it’s a tighter top I won’t be using them just because I don’t want there to be a chance I’ll lose one!I do want to point out though that these babies have had very regular use! Like at least 3-4 times a week and for long durations. I also will say that I didn't always clean them and store them properly right after wearing and I think letting them sit out could have dried up some of the adhesive a bit. Next time I will be sure to be more diligent!Anyways, to me it was worth every penny and I’m on my way to buying a fresh pair for the summer right now!","R4XJN96JETX57",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"26 people found this helpful","Just do it!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4XJN96JETX57/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PU9A9Q","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGYQSYGUFUDHCQHFOQXCV6OEXWSQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYQSYGUFUDHCQHFOQXCV6OEXWSQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: Size 2 (Fits D+ Cups), Color: Circles Caramel","B001PU9A9Q","Size","Size 2 (Fits D+ Cups)","Color","Circles Caramel",,

The silicone feels super soft and natural against the skin, and they’re just the right thickness to smooth everything out without looking bulky or obvious. I wore them under a tight dress at a wedding, danced all night, and they did not budge. Total lifesaver.The adhesive is strong but gentle—I’ve had no irritation at all, and they peel off cleanly every time. Bonus points for being washable and reusable. I’ve gotten at least 10 wears out of one pair so far, and they’re still going strong. Just make sure to follow the care instructions and store them in the original case.Whether you’re going braless for a backless dress or just want some extra coverage, these are a must-have.

I have a ridiculously small chest, I wear a 32AA but if the size existed I’d honestly fit better in a 28-30AA. Therefore I have an EXTREMELY hard time finding any real bra that fits me well and what does fit the best is sports bras. Unfortunately most sports bras don’t really have enough padding to conceal the outlines of this part of the breast (unfortunately with being a very small bust size I feel as though it just makes it even more noticeable) especially with any semi-tight top and there is nothing I hate more than having it show even slightly. For most of my life I’ve just avoided tops that are tighter but with a recent wardrobe change it became unavoidable and I needed some lighter browns which made the whole situation worse. So I decided to give this a try. I am so so so glad I did! It gives me enough coverage that even with a lightly padded sports bra I can still wear a more form fitting lighter colored top. They last all day (even in the height of summer and being outside in the sun all day and being fairly sweaty). I’ve reused the same pair multiple times and the adhesive despite numerous times hand washing. To ensure a good firm stick I do take a witch hazel toner over the area to remove any lotion, I’m not sure it is necessary to do that but I just want to make sure they stay put. I have very sensitive skin and despite the great grip it never bothers me! The only thing I kind of dislike is that if you sweat when you remove these there will be a dampness to the skin and covers BUT the dampness never ever leaks or shows and it never causes any kind of a rash or reaction on me. In fact the first time I used these was on a 90° day and after 6 hours outside and being hot dressed up in my Ren Faire clothes I was completely taken by surprise when I did remove them and discovered it was slightly damp, so you really can’t tell. I’m personally not a person that sweats much so my sweating in those conditions is much less than most people so perhaps someone else would have a different experience with these. The lack of sweating also means body odor really isn’t something I really worry about (I mean I use deodorant because you should not because I actually need to and that’s about the extent of my worry) but even with that dampness there was no odor. So for me that one things I’m not fond of is totally endurable because this product allows me to wear so many more tops with less self-consciousness! I have no idea if these are better or the same as cheaper brands because this was the first I tried and it worked so well I don’t plan on switching! I even swam with these once and they stayed on all day. I play volleyball, catch, frisbee, etc in the pool and don’t often dunk and swim a ton so if you swam submerged for hours I have no idea if they’d stay but for my activity that includes some dunking these things didn’t budge! I only got to try them once but this is going to allow me to wear a lot of bikini tops I would have avoided before!

My 12yo daughters favorite shoes, I wish it wasn't so, but it is. She will wear no others. She loves them because they are quick to put on, go with pants, shots and even summer dresses. We love them because the Croc brand is the most durable. It is the only brand we buy now after, trying many others. Also only brand we and anyone we know who has children buy. If you want to know why keep reading: Crocs brand has the best quality and durability. All of the children I know who wear this style shoe (I know 6 or 7) use the ankle strap everytime they wear the shoes (we call it wearing the shoe in Sport mode). My daughter has 1-2 pair of Crocs at any given time and its the only shoe she ever wears and always wears them in Sport mode (ankle strap engaged around ankle). Other brands, and all the kids I know have tried others, something always seems to go wrong with the ankle strap. Because all the kids I know use the ankle strap everytime they wear the shoe, once the ankle strap goes bad, the shoe is useless to the children. I buy my 12yo daughter a new pair of Crocs either through Amazon or the local shoe store, about every 6 months, and only because they are so stained the shoe is ugly; she wears the design off; or she outgrows them, but never once have we had to replace the Croc brand because the ankle strap broke. Other brands we have tried, the ankle strap breaks after 1 or 2 wears. My daughter has a very high activity level for a 12yo. She plays in the woods just about daily, goes to school 5 days a week, rides a bike in the summer, and sometimes goes to the park to run around. For us the durability and quality cannot be beat, and we will spend the little extra for that.","R3B4CYOCSLC2JS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6 people found this helpful","Quality and durability","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B4CYOCSLC2JS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014C0LSY","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGZXYQ4I2DKH2V5BHKFXE7ZPSKZA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGZXYQ4I2DKH2V5BHKFXE7ZPSKZA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Black, Size: 8 Women/6 Men","B0014C0LSY","Color","Black","Size","8 Women/6 Men",,

I’ve worn them on multiple occasions, from casual outings to quick trips around the house, and they’ve held up beautifully while keeping my feet happy the whole time.The comfort is unbeatable. The Croslite foam construction offers soft cushioning with every step, making these perfect for extended wear. Whether I’m running errands or standing for long periods, my feet never feel fatigued. The adjustable strap in the back allows for a custom fit, keeping them securely on my feet without feeling too tight. The arch support is surprisingly good for a casual shoe, which is a huge plus.Despite being made of lightweight material, these Crocs are incredibly durable. I’ve worn them in various environments—wet and dry—and they still look brand new. They’re easy to clean (a quick rinse with water and they’re good to go), and the soles offer excellent traction, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. They’ve handled everything from beach trips to quick walks without showing any signs of wear.The bright yellow color is a fun, bold choice. While Crocs are known for their quirky style, I find the yellow to be surprisingly versatile. It’s a cheerful pop of color that can complement a casual summer outfit, or just add a bit of flair to a laid-back day around the house. They’re perfect for anyone who wants to stand out with something more playful and vibrant.These yellow Crocs are more than just a fashion statement; they combine comfort, durability, and style in one easy-to-wear shoe. Whether you’re lounging at home, heading to the beach, or running errands, they’re the perfect footwear for effortless, all-day comfort.

I know i like a dark roast and gravitated towards those options in the sampler. They were all tasty, but chiaro was a clear favorite. I'm not good with notes but I will say it's robust, bold and smooth, producing a delightful crema and providing me with a nice wake up in the morning. It's so tasty, i use some steamed oatmilk, a dash of splenda, and Starbucks hasn't seen a dime from me in over 2 weeks!I also sought out reviews when choosing which flavor of nespresso capsules to purchase first. Most are sold in groups of 30, that being one of the better values anyway on amazon. Chiaro was one of the most highly rated amongst reviews of dark roast capsules! It was a clear choice for me after tasting the one sample that came in the sampler pack. I also really enjoyed the Dioppio Blanco, and Fortada, both dark roasts and espresso options. I am already on my 2nd order of 30 capsules...i have to remind myself these are double shots and to pace myself so as to keep my caffeine intake in check...it's that good!I highly recommend this flavor of capsule. It hits all the right spots. I'm not well versed in coffee, I don't quite understand notes but I do know I like a good dark roast, and I certaintly like certain brands and flavors of coffee from popular brands like Peets, Starbucks, Green Mountain and a few smaller local brands. As someone who used to frequent Starbucks, Peets Coffee or other barista almost daily, the Chiaro has made my switch to homemade espresso beverages so easy and delightful! I look forward to my morning coffee ritual  so much, it smells like my very own coffee house every morning! The espresso brews quickly, in about 40 seconds or less.I did see some mention in reviews for this capsule, or the Nespresso itself about the size of the output this capsule makes. On the sampler package, there was an informative diagram on the back that broke down the flavors into categories of type of beverage. Some categories were espresso,double espresso, coffee and one other. There was also included volume amounts in ounces. The espressos make about 1 ounce where the double espressos makes about about 2 ounces, double the size of an espresso.  The capsules meant for coffee beverages made 5-7 ounces of coffee. Whomever left those reviews didn't understand that and thought there was something wrong. The beverage is meant to be enjoyed wirh extra liquid, either milk or water (if making an americano). As I stated, I made a latte, using about 6 oz of steamed oatmilk. The chiaro double espresso and oatmilk together produce a strong, smooth coffee beverage totalling about 8 ounces, closer to the expected size.I do plan to branch out and expand my experience with other flavors I tried in the sampler. Another feature of the diagram on the sample packsging were included flavors ""you may also like"" listed below each flvor. So that if you enjoyed one flavor, you were given recommendations on others to try. I've kept that diagram and plan to reference it along with Amazon reviews when selecting my next package of nespreaso capsules. I do suggest you start with chiaro if you like dark roast. This is a good roast you cant really go wrong with.","R1SAZDG568NL84","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wybE-EuDL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UFy474t4L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71a5xhaep-L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"44 people found this helpful","So Yummy!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SAZDG568NL84/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07M8P8F73","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AHIMZOK6HS2D7DP6EUE2WLSBUTAQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHIMZOK6HS2D7DP6EUE2WLSBUTAQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Flavor Name: Chiaro","B07M8P8F73","Flavor Name","Chiaro",,,,

It’s smooth, balanced, and has just enough strength to start the day without being too intense or bitter. It definitely leans toward the lighter end of the espresso spectrum—closer to a mellow medium roast than a full-bodied Italian-style shot. Great for people who want a gentle wake-up or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up without the jitters.The crema is rich and consistent (as expected from the Vertuo system), and it brews perfectly every time. It pairs well with milk for lattes or cortados, though the flavor can get a little lost if you use too much.My only reason for knocking off a star is that it’s not as bold or layered as some of the other Vertuo espresso options. If you prefer strong, complex notes or a deeper roast, this might feel a little underwhelming. But if you like your espresso smooth and easygoing, this is a great everyday option.Overall, it’s a high-quality, reliable pod that delivers a mellow but satisfying shot every time.

Although Sam is taking up the mantle of Captain America, he does have this song doubt that he doesn’t deserve it but Bucky a.k.a. the winter soldier told him that Steve chose him for a reason because he saw that he was a good man and would see the good in the people, and to give the people to believe in something.

No action, boring dialogue and missed opportunities. I disagree on all accounts.The action continues throughout the entirety of its near two hour length, the story reveals itself by way of Cap searching for the real threat and the discovery of a new element has just opened the world up to so much potential.There were a couple of moments that seemed to pander to the audience, but those moments weren’t all that intrusive anyway. There is only one scene during the credits, quite unnecessary in all honesty, and it is by far the weakest part of the whole.

Also you will get digital version (compressed) if you mobile anywhere and a bluray version for you to gift it to someone you love plus extra benefit you can get with the bluray is the contents which is not available in cinema such as behind the scene etc.","R1YK3SQW0Y7GTU","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gx4IuPWXL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","VISUAL AND AUDIO IS SUPERB, VALUE BUY","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YK3SQW0Y7GTU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F4B68F6X","Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEXYUXVGFFV3DUXJEX4JSY6FYJPQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEXYUXVGFFV3DUXJEX4JSY6FYJPQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F4B68F6X",,,,,,

The film picks up following the events of the Disney+ television series “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” as well as continuing on from the “Captain America” and “Avengers” films. In the story, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) now works as Captain America and is aided by Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), the new Falcon. They find themselves drawn into a spy game following the election of Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford, replacing the late William Hurt) to the Presidency and the geopolitical ramifications of the discovery of adamantium in the Celestial Island left over from the events of Chloé Zhao’s 2021 film, “Eternals.” The film sets up a race for resources with Japan and the United States as the largest players in the contest. President Ross and Cap have their own rocky history, made all the worse when a trigger sets off Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) at a White House reception, forcing Cap to help capture his old friend while also figuring out what the President is hiding.The film introduces Sidewinder (Giancarlo Esposito) and Copperhead (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson) as members of Serpent, thereby using an early story idea for the third Cap film before it was changed to “Civil War.” While other Marvel projects have hearkened back to Louis Leterrier’s 2008 film, “The Incredible Hulk,” hoping to demonstrate the importance of the second entry in the MCU through cameos in Destin Daniel Cretton’s 2021 film, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” and Jessica Gao’s 2022 Disney+ series, “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,” Onah uses “Brave New World” to tie together the most threads from “Incredible Hulk” with Thaddeus Ross’ prominent role, the return of Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) who had his brain exposed to gamma in “Incredible Hulk,” and a brief cameo from Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Just as “Civil War” was both a Cap film and an Iron Man film, “Brave New World” is both a Cap film and a Hulk film.At times, the political thriller elements struggle to hold suspense since the film’s marketing gave away several of the biggest twists. Harrison Ford gives one of his best dramatic performance, imbuing the character with more pathos than William Hurt had been able to do in previous films (not due to a lack on Hurt’s part, but because of how those prior films used the character). For his part, Anthony Mackie continues to demonstrate why he was the right person to take up the shield and become Cap. He shows mercy, compassion, and introspection even as he’s delivers fantastically choreographed and athletic fight scenes. Shira Haas rounds out the cast as Ruth Bat-Seraph, who Onah reimagines as a former Black Widow. Changes to the character’s origin and costume help with some of the controversy surrounding her inclusion given current real-world events. Further, the character’s initial debut in the “Hulk” comics adds to the role of the Hulk mythos in this movie. Unfortunately, the film doesn’t make her a mutant and thus misses the opportunity to use both her inclusion and the appearance of adamantium to further lay the groundwork for the X-Men. Overall, “Brave New World” is an enjoyable film with Anthony Mackie shining as Cap, but the film struggles to balance several subplots and could have used the political thriller elements to greater effect as an allegory for our own political situation. Ford’s portrayal of President Ross and the parallels to “The Manchurian Candidate” work particularly well.This Blu-Ray/4K steelbook is a great way for Cap fans to add this film to their collection. It includes featurettes about Anthony Macke’s portrayal of Sam Wilson over the years, a look at Sam’s greatest foes, a gag reel, deleted scenes, and audio commentary. I do wish there was more about the effects both practical and digital as well as an inclusion of art cards like Marvel has done in the past. The art on the packaging is particularly nice and recalls some of the current posters for John Frankenheimer’s 1962 film, “The Manchurian Candidate.”","R1IM1KZ6GGIYVM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fun, but Often Balancing Too Many Plot Threads","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IM1KZ6GGIYVM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F4B68F6X","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGEKA6WODQNV3G5QBLHTEBDDZNQA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEKA6WODQNV3G5QBLHTEBDDZNQA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F4B68F6X",,,,,,

From the moment the first episode begins, you’re swept into a world that feels both raw and authentic, a hallmark of Sheridan's storytelling. His ‘Midas touch’ is evident in every frame, from the intricately woven plots to the rich character development that keeps viewers invested.The Landman series is a brilliant exploration of the complexities of land, oil, power, and the human condition. Sheridan has a unique ability to blend intense drama with poignant social commentary, and this series is no exception. Each character is meticulously crafted and the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. Each shot is thoughtfully composed, capturing the stark beauty of the landscapes while enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Sheridan’s keen eye for detail transforms the setting into a character of its own, adding layers to the story that resonate long after the credits roll.The writing is sharp, witty, and often laced with a deep sense of humanity. Sheridan tackles challenging themes with grace, making the audience reflect on issues that are both timely and timeless. The dialogue crackles with authenticity, and Billy Bob Thornton is stellar in his performance.In the film industry where this is a lot of terrible films somehow getting produced and where storytelling can often feel formulaic, Taylor Sheridan continues to push boundaries and redefine what television can achieve. The Landman series is a testament to his genius, proving once again that he is a master of his craft. This series deserves all the accolades and praise it receives, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Prepare yourself for an intense and emotional rollercoaster that will leave you craving more!","R3SLEG4FWND5ES",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7 people found this helpful","Phenomenal!

I'm very happy it was because I ordered 5, three prints and the white and a black solid.  Thank you to those who shared the same experience.  I'm in Texas, so it is hot much of the year.  I like the thinness of the fabric.  It doesn't look cheap, and it doesn't look expensive. It looks good. Maybe a print looks cheap...ok, pick a better print, material is good.  It's perfect to be dressed up or down.  Mine look great and are cool and breezy.  Only two of my prints had color and they were just like the photos, beautiful.  One print had a different variation of hem in the front but still, just like the photo.  The other four had the same curvature in the front so, yes there can be some variations in style.  I only saw a variation of 1-2 inches in sleeve length and fit when closing the front sides together, which I was able to do by 1–2-inch overlap.  I am 5'5 and the length came to upper mid-thigh on sides and covered the bum completely.  I do not have a big bum or a flat bum. With my bum and my small tummy and the front panels touching together, the fabric had a straight, falling drape in back from side view, no hugging. I have an hourglass shape.  At a 36C, my tummy does not extend past my bust.  Having said that, I normally buy a large 12-14 or a 10-12 size top and always a 12 bottom. I size for myself a slightly loose fit, not snug or tight.  If one likes snug fit, it could seem too big.  I expected a jacket style like this with drape and flow and that's what I got.  The bust and hip of the large fit me true to size.  It did not fall off my shoulders.  I did try one on with a shoulder covered shirt with grip and one with a spaghetti strap dress, no grip, and it fit my shoulders fine with no slip off on either.  Arm space had good room, drape and flow too.  I have good strong arms, not thin or small.  My shoulders are an average width and large fits them every time.  Fabric is a sheer polyester as was presented and expected.  Anything heavier would be too hot, in my opinion.  It is a summer staple and shouldn't be hot or heavy, especially in a hot climate where panty hose can suffocate you.  The sewing appeared to be satisfactory and solid hems on all I purchased.  They can wrinkle, so hanging up is advisable.  They are lightweight and I hung all of them over each other on one hanger, not a big deal or heavy.  These were exactly what I was looking for to balance me with spaghetti straps, which I don't look great in but love to wear.  I was excited to find them but figuring out the true sizing in reviews was crazy.  My experience is true to size, comfortable, perfect for my purposes, satisfactory crafted for value, colors and prints as portrayed.  The curvature of the front could be tricky for some to adjust to different body styles.  The photos were great to see this with.  I love them and would recommend.","R163XCSDGVIY52","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ENp7AxKgL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41tqWK9b7FL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412wXxNwtQL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yKNXy4KSL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"121 people found this helpful","True to size","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R163XCSDGVIY52/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SN9RS13","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHTOOZRIXHRQCY5KWQPXYHJYSQ7A","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHTOOZRIXHRQCY5KWQPXYHJYSQ7A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: Large, Color: Blue Dark Floral","B07SN9RS13","Size","Large","Color","Blue Dark Floral",,

I wouldn't use it for a swimsuit coverup, though - you need fabric that is more substantial.I've found that a sheer coverup like this or a thin, glittery wrap will allow me to wear a plain knit dress or casual pants and a t-shirt and still look a bit dressy.  Especially good for traveling, as these pack down to nothing.  I mostly travel with carryon luggage only, so I don't take one-use clothes. If I'm going out for dinner, or on a cruise dress-up night, all I have to do is wear something like this over the same solid color knit dress or slacks/capris I wear every day, and my look is upgraded significantly.","R3GS5ZCH212HYB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4 people found this helpful","Beautiful design","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GS5ZCH212HYB/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SN9RS13","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHYXTX6I57AHEY344OEKZCSBWBEA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYXTX6I57AHEY344OEKZCSBWBEA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: Medium, Color: Gloden Blue","B07SN9RS13","Size","Medium","Color","Gloden Blue",,

They hit s few inches below the top of the thigh. Still, they are acceptable for me.  Light weight and of course sheer, patterns obscure the sheerness somewhat if that is a concern. Perfect for warmer weather. Pair up with just about anything. Pants, jeans, shorts, and tees, even dresses. All in all, happy with this purchase and price was very reasonable.","R3TT1PYGKDRMDJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"15 people found this helpful","Nice cover ups","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TT1PYGKDRMDJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SN9RS13","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEEUZ5UYYFM7DNNR6R5J3UJDSIVA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEEUZ5UYYFM7DNNR6R5J3UJDSIVA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: Medium, Color: Dark Grey","B07SN9RS13","Size","Medium","Color","Dark Grey",,

But before I start, I have to say that in general, I think the mint flavors are best. They last the longest due to the cooling sensation, and do the best job freshening the breath. However, in general, the flavor doesn't last as long as sugared gum or aspartame/acesulfame K gum. I've not noticed any kind of G.I upset from chewing these, and I often chew several pieces a day. But I know some people can be sensitive to xylitol, so bear that in mind.As for the flavors:Cool mint- not a big fan of this one. It has a slightly bitter flavor to it, kind of like a cucumber mint taste. It lasts decently long.Spearmint- very tasty, very fresh, one of the longest lasting. It's one of my favorites.Wintermint- it's also long lasting, but has an aftertaste I'm not crazy about. To be fair, I'm not a big fan of wintermint flavor in most things. If you're a fan of wintermint, this might be for you.Peppermint- a strong, clean bite, very fresh and long lasting. It has a true-to-peppermint flavor. This is also a favorite.Pomegranate mint- this one is a surprise favorite, with the fruity flavor wonderfully complimenting the mint, which is lighter than the other mints. The pomegranate flavor is bright and strong, and lasts a decent amount of time. I have found that the flavor lasting time can vary from piece to piece, but I suppose that's to be expected.Bubblegum- I really want to like this one. The base bubblegum flavor is pretty good, but this flavor lasts the shortest time, and once the flavor is gone, it tastes kinda rubbery.Cinnamon- this one is pretty good. It's not a super strong cinnamon, but it definitely warms me up a bit and is as good for freshening breath as the mint ones. It's becoming one of my favorites, and easier to chew on a winter day 😉 It lasts decently long.Chocolate mint- I actually got this pack intending to try this one, as I'd had most of these before. And I'm glad I did. This one is surprisingly tasty, with a good full bodied chocolate flavor and a perfect hit of mint. Both flavors are well balanced, and when the chocolate disappears, the mint lingers. It lasts about as long as the pomegranate mint.So would I recommend these? Definitely, especially if you love chewing gum but don't want all the extra sugar. And buying them in bulk like this is pretty economical, as this bundle is much cheaper per pack than buying them in store. If you're new to Pur, I'd recommend starting with the mint flavors first.

Each volume of Collector’s Choice was a single disc.That effort has now been rebranded as Collector’s Vault.  However, it has expanded to include two discs in each volume for only a few dollars more than the single disc Collector’s Choice volumes.The first disc will continue the trend of releasing shorts never offered on any Looney Tunes disc collection (DVD or Blu-Ray) in remastered form.  This is essentially what would have been Collector’s Choice Volume 5.  The additional second disc will contain shorts never offered on Blu-Ray in high definition.  For example, this will include shorts available on the Golden Collection DVDs that pre-dated Blu-Ray.This approach will allow Warner Archives to continue releasing new material (disc 1) while also upgrading SD/DVD shorts to HD/Blu-Ray (disc 2).I would not consider this approach “double dipping,” and I would not consider it cheating us out of additional new material.  Instead, it is a cost-effective way to get both new remastered cartoons out on disc, while also upgrading ones that were previously DVD only.Note that the 1-disc Collectors Choice volumes list for $21.99 while the new 2-disc Collectors Vault volume lists for $24.99.  For $3 extra dollars, we get double the shorts.I’m hopeful people support these new volumes so we can continue to get Looney Tunes on Blu-Ray for years to come, and eventually complete the library.Side note, it was revealed that the inclusion of “DOUBLE OR MUTTON” in this collection was a mistake, as it was already released in Collector’s Choice Volume 4.  However, it was also announced they would make up for this error by including an “extra” disc one short (26 instead of 25) on Collector’s Vault volume 2 when it is released.","R3HYZV15AT9B8G",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"49 people found this helpful","Consider this Collectors Choice Volume 5, but better!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HYZV15AT9B8G/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F5S7GHCQ","Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHMJV75TZV5X6IJFRS6E65UN2SRQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMJV75TZV5X6IJFRS6E65UN2SRQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F5S7GHCQ",,,,,,

I have all the Golden LT DVD sets and I have no problem paying an extra $3.00 here to get an entire disc of the already remastered shorts from the DVDs but in beautiful high definition. That is an upgrade in my humble opinion and not a double dip move. That’s not to say WB has never pulled the double dip move but this doesn’t count. WB has really done a good job giving fans of the classic Looney Tunes a lot of love when it comes to all the work they’ve done restoring and remastering so many wonderful Looney Tunes shorts. These classic cartoons deserve to be restored to their original glory and WB treats these like the important American cultural history they are. I hope someday we have all the DVD shorts brought to HD blu ray. What a joy that would be to watch these with future grandkids. 😊","R2UYFGCJO61T7J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6 people found this helpful","Kellye’s review and insight spot on","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UYFGCJO61T7J/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F5S7GHCQ","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFD72GER3O7H3OK742UMOWUFC67Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFD72GER3O7H3OK742UMOWUFC67Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F5S7GHCQ",,,,,,

I wore them almost daily.  Unlike prior years, I never complained once about stepping on something uncomfortable.  Sand will enter the shoes but it was less than other similar shoes I've owned.My right shoe was a solid performer; however, as I walked, the left shoe insole slid forward, backward, folded in half, etc. every single time, and even from the very first wear. It was so annoying that I removed it altogether at one point, which wasn't very comfortable but was better than dealing with the problem insole. Eventually, I put it back in for comfort.  I'll probably get rid of this pair, and don't know that I would buy this brand of shoe again.","RUAG6A40F57E8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"9 people found this helpful","Protective and Comfy, But Shifting Insole is a Problem","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUAG6A40F57E8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09Q3MYDQH","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AE6O7YT3RH5AJQ34VLXNOOOROL2Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE6O7YT3RH5AJQ34VLXNOOOROL2Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 8.5-9.5 Women/7.5-8.5 Men, Color: Rosy Clouds","B09Q3MYDQH","Size","8.5-9.5 Women/7.5-8.5 Men","Color","Rosy Clouds",,

They have held up well in the laundry over time, with no shrinking, pilling or deterioration of the fabric or of the elastic, and no problems with the stitching popping or anything like that.  I was surprised how much I liked them, to be honest, because I was skeptical about the great price point -- that's why I only ordered a couple of pairs initially.  However, when I I recently reordered more to stock up on what was supposed to be the exact same style, exact same size, the underwear that showed up in the mail yesterday are ENORMOUS!  In the attached photos you can see the salmon pink pair of size Large that I ordered a year ago, and the white pair of size Large that I just received.  This is not due to shrinkage either; elastic does not shrink -- if the fabric of my pink underwear had shrunk that significantly, the elastic would be all rippled and wavy like ruffles around the edges.  Clearly there has been a drastic change to the sizing at the factory, or maybe Amazon switched to a different factory that is cutting everything larger.  I am super bummed.  I will be exchanging these for size Medium and I'm hoping they send me something closer to what was previously sized Large.","RW88LT5UFW7AC","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fqSRNOgqL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Gh46j2PKL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"86 people found this helpful","Fantastic comfort and quality, but SIZING has changed drastically!

The flavor is not overtly coconut or coffee or nutty. It’s a very nice blend and the flavors compliment each other making for a pretty dynamic taste. It’s not overtly sweet either, even though some folks might scoff of the sugar content. The texture is very soft and a tiny bit gummy, but not in an unpleasant way. I would love this bar to be chocolate coated for a real treat, but it’s enjoyable as it is. It is a little pricy, but I can justify it for myself considering what I like and need.

It doesn’t put you off eating it to start, but it’s it’s comparable to the RX bar and if you can stomach those then you can stomach these. They have a little bit more protein than RX. More fiber which is why I’m going to keep them for sure and keep them in the rotation, but they just won’t be something I may buy often if the other bars that I’m testing out are better texture.  protein bars are Hard to get good.

It includes three flavors: Sweet Vanilla, Roasted Hazelnut, and Golden Caramel, each offering its own unique tasting experience. I’ve been using these pods daily and here’s my detailed breakdown:Sweet Vanilla:This is the most subtle of the three, with a light, smooth vanilla flavor that doesn't overpower the coffee. It blends beautifully with milk or cream and works particularly well for iced coffee. The vanilla is more of a whisper than a bold note, perfect if you like a gentle sweetness rather than something too dessert-like. While it wasn’t my personal favorite, I can see why it’s one of Nespresso’s best sellers. It's refined, versatile, and crowd-pleasing.Best enjoyed: Iced or with a splash of almond or oat milk. Brewed on ""strong"" for added depth.Roasted Hazelnut:This one really surprised me! I wasn’t expecting to love it as much as I did. The hazelnut flavor is rich, toasty, and incredibly comforting. It has a warm, nutty aroma right from the brew and pairs beautifully with a morning pastry or a cozy afternoon break. What impressed me most is that the hazelnut flavor tasted natural and smooth, not overly artificial or sweet.Golden Caramel:The whole reason I bought this pack, and while it didn’t hit with the bold caramel punch I expected, it still delivered a smooth and mellow flavor. The caramel is more understated than what you’d find in a sugary latte, but that makes it easier to enjoy daily without feeling like you’re drinking dessert. It’s balanced and elegant, which I’ve grown to appreciate.If you're looking for a flavored Nespresso variety pack that’s flavorful without being overpowering, this is a five-star pick.

The Caramel Cookie is perfect for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, and the Hazelino Muffin is like a cozy breakfast in a cup.If you're a fan of flavored coffees that taste authentic (and not artificial or syrupy), this pack is absolutely worth trying.

To read exactly what I think of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 version, feel free to read my review on that film.  I'm not going to compair, I'll just tell you what I feel with this film on it's own merit.  Lets begin...The package. 4 Stars.  The cover looks brutal, with what would be a face of a person that Leatherface cut off and did some nifty stitch work. I was dissapointed that when I opened up the CD case though, mine had no inlay inside at all, only the disc. hmm Not sure if this was normal or not but thats it.  The extras on the disc are very nice and the CD is easy to pop out and yet the holder holds it into place very well.  I hate when cases are put together bad and it's a nightmare to pop out the disc, this one is no problem.  So all and all, I love the cover art, but was let down by the fact, no inlay at all.Spook Meter.  5 Stars.  WOW, what can be said here except well, BRUTAL.  This film is just creepy.  I will never look at a sheriff the same way again after seeing the sheriff in this film.  The family is creepy and the sherrif played the role extreamly well.  I don't think I would ever want to meet that guy face to face, he played the role that well. I did not sleep to well after watching this film.  This film is very intense, brutal horror plain and simple.  This is not a ""fun campy"" type horror film by any means.  This is a film that was made to make the viewer very umcomfortable and it does a great job at that. We see in this version of the film just how Leatherface became who he turned into later in life.  I really liked how this movie started and did a great job explaining different things. Well acting overall, some parts I thought with some of the kids could have been a bit better acted out, but the sheriff and the family more then make up for that.  Leatherface is very intense, I love how he at times would turn off his chainsaw for a moment and seach around for his victim, then start it back up when it felt he was near them.  Little things like that can really add to the creepy feel and it did.  He did not have his chain saw going all the time and when he did have that thing revved up well... hahahha read on.Gore Meter.  10 Stars!  Oh wait.. It only goes up to 5 stars max.  Ok, 5 stars!!  The blood, gore is very extream in this film! While some horror films show the action and then leave a lot to your imagination, this film goes the other way in a big way!  Just remember if you watch this, it's fake blood and people are not really being killed.  You will have to say that to yourself a few times to get through this.  I don't like to give much details away when I do a review.  Let's just put it this way.  Most all horror films don't even come close to the gore level that you will see when watching this.  If you have a weak stomach, AVOID this movie. Personally I LOVED all the blood and gore.  In this film it just came together very well.Profanity Meter. 5 Strikes.  I can deal with gore, I can handle a creepy movie and thats fine.  I was dissapointed that the profanity is also very extream.  I just personally find profanity to actually take away from a film. Lucky for me I have a DVD system that cuts out language and it was working overtime when I played this.Sexual Meter:  1 Strikes.  Nothing sexual in this film, just a ton of violence and gore.Final thoughts:  This film does what it was meant to.  It explains things very well and it is not a comfortable film to watch.  With that said, overall I was very pleased with how well this was made.  There are a few setbacks that I named above but I really overall loved this film.  If you want a to watch a horror film that will freak you out and does not hold back the brutal violence, this IS the film to watch.  I have to say, I really hope there IS another Chainsaw film in the future.  I love  this film, and I can't get enough of the Hewitt Family!!  Leatherface! Keep that chainsaw warm and I hope you return to the big screen again soon!!!","R2VWTKFYJCQVWQ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4 people found this helpful","In one word....

But I always found it truly appropriate for the inherently cruel story and characters. They were meant to be insidious psychopathic cannibals, right? So following in the same shocking vein, this prequel opens with a viscerally graphic birth scene complete with a slimy animatronic fetus on the floor of a slaughterhouse. That visual alone ought to inform you if this film is for you. Clearly, it’s trying to push the limits of the 2003 reboot.The unsightly baby is rescued from an offal dumpster and taken to the old Hewitt house; the opening credit sequence is littered with visuals of lacerated flesh and the sounds of wet chunks of meat being squeezed between fingers; and the language describing Thomas “Leatherface” Hewitt (Andrew Bryniarski; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Mother’s Day) is not just culturally insensitive, but brutal.In current day 1969 two twenty-something couples are driving across the country. After a car accident, Bailey (Diora Baird; Night of the Demons, 30 Days of Night: Dark Days), Chrissie (Jordana Brewster; The Faculty), Eric (Matt Bomer; American Horror Story, The Sinner) and Dean (Taylor Handley; Bird Box) are picked up by the sheriff and taken to his home. A glowing example of psychopathy, “Sheriff Hoyt” (R. Lee Ermey; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Rift, The Frighteners, Up from the Depths, The Watch) takes every opportunity to rattle our senses as the most vile entity we meet in this story. Leatherface is an animal, but Hoyt is a true monster.The pacing is strong. True to its 2003 and 1974 source material, this movie’s violence is jarringly abrupt and abundant. From roadkilled cow and dispatched bikers, to hammer homicide and peeling off entire faces, the action starts right away and takes few breaks from shocking us. For example, Leatherface’s hammer game is strong in this movie! Not since Annie Wilkes in Misery (1990) have I seen someone so brutally hobbled, making bone meal out of a poor guy’s knees.This Leatherface is also among the grossest (although not so perverted as in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), with a degenerative skin disease and his arms seem perpetually discolored in dry oxidized blood. He’s always sweaty, he’s always filthy, and his presence feels the most menacing of any TCM film (1974-2017).We see heads get blown apart, horrendous beatings, someone getting chainsawed in half, legs are amputated on screen, and skin get flayed before our eyes. We also enjoy (I think) the most chainsaw deaths and attacks of the entire franchise from originals to reboots. Personally, I’d say director Jonathan Liebesman (Darkness Falls, Battle Los Angeles, Wrath of the Titans) did well by TCM fans, and his amped up brutality really just seems to follow the trend in TCM movies leading up to this.This movie is a blast for gorehounds! I haven’t seen 2003 recently enough to say for sure, but this and 1986 might just be my two favorite TCM movies.","RHR8XZWHORH7K",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"18 people found this helpful","Incredibly gory, abruptly brutal, and unrelenting in its indecency.

Gave 4 stars because it's still Hint, lol.Again, none of this tastes BAD... who doesn't love a Creamsicle?  But those aren't the flavors I personally go for in Hint water, I much prefer straight fruit types.  Even and especially smashups, but without any other kind of non-fruit flavor profile mixed in.I didn't care for the Holiday special edition for the same reason- disliked the chocolate taste of the peppermint bark flavor, disliked the cinnamon essence in the apple flavor- made it taste oddly ""dusty"".  Love chocolate and cinnamon both, just not in my water.Now, a plain spearmint or peppermint flavor water would be AWESOME- maybe some of you remember MetroMint water?  I miss that brand, and I miss Hint's cucumber flavor too, but those are easy to make for yourself.But I digress... Back to Summer Edition...  They don't taste bad.

As a longtime fan of the game, I went in with high hopes—but what I experienced was beyond anything I could have imagined. This film isn’t just a video game adaptation; it’s a love letter to the creativity, adventure, and endless possibilities that Minecraft represents. It’s a thrilling, heartwarming, and visually stunning journey that captures the essence of the game while telling a story that resonates with both die-hard fans and newcomers alike.A Faithful Yet Fresh Take on the Minecraft UniverseOne of my biggest worries was whether the movie would stay true to the spirit of Minecraft while still offering something new. I’m thrilled to say it absolutely does! The world-building is phenomenal—every blocky tree, every creeper lurking in the shadows, every sprawling biome feels like it was pulled straight from the game, yet expanded in ways that make the universe feel alive. The attention to detail is astounding, from the iconic sound effects (that ""ssss"" still terrifies me) to the way characters craft tools and build structures in real-time.The story is a perfect blend of adventure, humor, and emotion. Without spoiling anything, it follows a group of unlikely heroes—some familiar faces and some new—as they embark on an epic quest to save their world from a looming threat. The pacing is fantastic, balancing intense action sequences with quieter, heartfelt moments that give the characters real depth. And yes, there are plenty of Easter eggs and references that will have fans grinning from ear to ear.Stellar Voice Acting and Characters You’ll LoveThe casting is spot-on. Every voice actor brings their character to life with so much personality and charm. Steve (played by an incredibly talented actor) is everything we hoped for—stoic yet expressive, brave yet relatable. The supporting cast, including a hilarious parrot sidekick and a surprisingly complex villain, adds so much flavor to the story. Even the mobs—zombies, skeletons, and of course, the ever-menacing Ender Dragon—are given moments to shine in ways that feel fresh and exciting.Visual Spectacle – Blocky Beauty Brought to LifeThe animation style is a perfect marriage of Minecraft’s signature blocky aesthetic and cinematic polish. The way light filters through leaves, water flows dynamically, and explosions send blocks flying is nothing short of breathtaking. The action sequences are fluid and exhilarating, especially a climactic battle that had me on the edge of my seat. And the Nether and End dimensions? Absolutely stunning—vibrant, dangerous, and full of surprises.A Soundtrack That Hits All the Right NotesThe music is a beautiful mix of nostalgic Minecraft melodies and sweeping orchestral pieces that elevate every scene. Hearing those iconic C418-inspired tunes reimagined with a full cinematic score gave me chills. The sound design, from the clinking of pickaxes to the roar of the Ender Dragon, is immersive and perfectly craftedI am steveChicken JockeyFlint and Steel!THE NETHERThis is a CRAFTING TABLEthey love CRUSHING A LOAFtheyre the VILLAGERSwater bucket RELEASEsteves LAVA CHICKENender PEARLdiamond armor FULL SETas a child I yearned for the minesI am placing blocks and sh","R249KRY2X9GX18",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"31 people found this helpful","Absolutely life changing","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R249KRY2X9GX18/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F22GMVDL","Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHGVVW3VXGCAQYY4MHIDNDUT6UXQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGVVW3VXGCAQYY4MHIDNDUT6UXQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F22GMVDL",,,,,,

Before the movie there was this kid who said, when I say flint you say steel, not one person failed on that request. Honestly I wish more movies had this amazing interaction in the theaters, and at home will not be the same but still it will be a wonderful movie for a date night. I had a friend who brought his girl to the movie theater and shared popcorn with her. And I sat by my huzz to. Honestly my future children will know the date of April 4th, 2025, truly a date to remember. I wish we could all get dementia and watch the movie all over again.  But there was only 3 sad parts in the movie I have to let you guys know about. First, when pink sheep died, honestly a 5 year old three seats down almost broke down, could not blame him, you could see the zombies tearing at. RIP. Next was when Steve was saying goodbye to Dennis. Honestly such an amazing sad moment. Beautiful amazing song by Steve in that. Finally the ending of the movie. After the movie, we all stayed late, and the employees were getting pissed at us. Also another great part was Steve's lava chicken song, made a tear roll out of my eye.","R3D5P2AEF1Y9IE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10 people found this helpful","""Absolute cinema"" (POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW BUT THEY ARE SMALL)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D5P2AEF1Y9IE/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F22GMVDL","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHTQMNSWZNQU46E6F47EOIBWIN6Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHTQMNSWZNQU46E6F47EOIBWIN6Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F22GMVDL",,,,,,

As a fan of the game itself – they could have done so much more with this movie than they did. Two dimensional characters, ridiculous story and just plain dull overall. Why?Directed by Jared Hess just leaned on the bad story too much. Too many cooks in the kitchen syndrome because the screenplay was written by Chris Bowman, Hubbel Palmer, Neil Widener, Gavin James and Chris Galletta (from a story by Allison Schroeder, Chris Bowman and Palmer). It was nothing new, nothing fun or nothing really interesting but they could have done so much more in this wonderful classic game universe.What is the story? A mysterious portal pulls four cardboard-performing misfits into the Overworld, a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master the terrain while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected crafter named Steve. All the attacks, saves and rescues are so unoriginal and predictable. Yawn.Jason Momoa is flecking every 5 minutes. Jack Black is singing and Jack-Blacking’ every 5 minutes. Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers and Sebastian Hansen are doing their best. And even Jennifer Coollidge was trying hard to be funny and actually was.The film is completed CG’d and the cinematography by Enrique Chediak is colorful and the editing by James Thomas kept the film moving fast with the music by Mark Mothersbaugh getting the emotion rushes, but again, the story.

As a guy who's seen the stage show, once I went in with a healthy dose of skepticism, but came out genuinely impressed. They've taken a beloved classic and given it a visually stunning, emotionally resonant cinematic makeover.First off, the world of Oz is absolutely breathtaking. They've translated the stage magic into a sprawling, vibrant spectacle. It’s like stepping into a living painting, every scene bursting with color and detail. It’s a feast for the eyes, even for those of us who usually prefer our entertainment with a bit more… explosions.The story, as always, is a masterclass in nuanced storytelling. It's not just about good versus evil; it's about friendship, acceptance, and the power of perspective. They’ve captured the heart of the show perfectly, and even added some new layers that really enhance the experience.The performances are top-notch. They’ve brought these iconic characters to life with such depth and authenticity. The chemistry between Elphaba and Glinda is electric, and their vocal performances are simply stunning.

As a little girl, no older than 4, the colors and singing reeled me into a life long love for the play — of course, nothing can make it better than the orginal cast. The next year, I was gifted the Wizard of Oz movie and of course Ruby slippers (because what 5 year old can go without), allowing me to further grow my love of the Oz world. Seeing the play again in 2013, I feel in love with Oz as a whole.When I heard in 2015 that there was talk of a movie version, I was a tad skeptical. By 2019, when I read the book version, I was very worried which way a movie version can go.With covid and working in healthcare, I looked no further into the movie until late 2022, when I heard that Ariana Grande had been casted as Glinda from a theatre friend. As a girl who grew up on Victorious and her music, I became excited for the future of the movie. Cynthia Erivio, I knew less about, only knowing her via The Greatest Showman and glimpses I saw of Harriet. By 2024, my skepticism waned, and like any Wicked enthusiast, I went to the theatre with mild unease, but came out with joy.The producers and actors/actresses were able to bring the wonders of Oz to tbe big screen. With action, color, glam, this is a must watch for all ages. It combines learning acceptance, the power of friendship, all the great teachings of the play into one. While I can admit, I’m not the world’s biggest fan of muscicals, this is one I will cherish time and time again.Even in the first few moment’s of the movie, it foreshadows the second act. Spoiler alert: I love the Easter eggs to the Wizard of Oz. With the well known songs of “Popular” and “Defying Gravity,” I felt a part of the world, especially when watching the 3d version. Who knew monkeys flying out the screen would give such a crazy jump scare? 😂But no more spoilers. I hope you and your families or friends enjoy.Please note, some parts may not be child friendly — just because I saw the play at 4 does not mean your child should. There is nothing inappropriate nor language, but it can be overwhelming and mildly violent with some more adult references.The physical DVD wise:The 4k dvd is “ehh” at best. The colors pop, but the sound vibrates every time a song plays, catching on major notes and ruining the show for me. I believe it’s just the dvd’s manufacturing, as playing the same version on MovieEverywhere does not lead to this annoying vibration/lagging. And yes, I did try three dvd player’s and multiple tv’s to verify it was not my ears — all player’s that are meant for 4k dvd’s. The non-4K DVD worked fine. If not for the DVD’s issue, I would have given 5 stars.","R1WM21NORUPH4Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","A One in a Million Masterpiece 🥰","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WM21NORUPH4Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNKY21JB","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEVSY7675ZGRPXEKSFEXZKU2PDVQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVSY7675ZGRPXEKSFEXZKU2PDVQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DNKY21JB",,,,,,

I am 5'8"" and 140"", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked.I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.I hope that this review is helpful to you.Update - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer.  Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver.I purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out.  I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don't need a big neck. I am still 5'8"" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however,  I like a looser-fitting T-shirt.I will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat.Notably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them.June 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral.September 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on ""energy saving"", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out.November 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them.  They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum.November 28, 2020 -  I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom.March 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors.September 16, 2021 - The T-shirts are still doing well. One note, I think that the 6.0 weight fabric is much better than the 5.3 weight fabric. I bought some 5.3 weight lime green T-shirts to try to make myself more visible when walking. The necks have sagged after four washes. They served the purpose for the summer. However, I would not buy the 5.3 ounce again. The 6.0 ounce T-shirts have maintained their shape with minimal neck sagging or crinkling.","R3HWHIZ8U0HDKJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1,254 people found this helpful","Solid value T-shirts","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HWHIZ8U0HDKJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075ZZ7XKD","Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2018",,,"amzn1.account.AHNJZSAVGPRXFYZTGD2QLUB3IGQQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHNJZSAVGPRXFYZTGD2QLUB3IGQQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: Large, Color: Charcoal (2-pack), Number of Items: 2","B075ZZ7XKD","Size","Large","Color","Charcoal (2-pack)","Number of Items","2"

The first thing I noticed when I tried it on was how incredibly soft the fabric feels. It's made from 100% cotton, which makes it breathable and comfortable, especially for casual wear during warmer days. The material is thick, but not too heavy, giving it a nice, durable feel without being uncomfortable.The yellow color is vibrant and eye-catching, perfect for adding a pop of brightness to any outfit. Whether you're wearing it on its own or layering it, the shade definitely stands out, and I love how it adds a fun, energetic vibe to my wardrobe.However, the fit is where I had a bit of an issue. The shirt runs slightly oversized. It's not a huge problem, as the extra room can be comfortable if you’re looking for a relaxed, laid-back style. But if you prefer a more tailored, fitted look, this shirt might feel a bit too loose around the torso and sleeves. For reference, I ordered my usual size, and I found that it fit more like a large rather than a true medium.All in all, if you don’t mind a looser fit, this Gildan t-shirt is a great choice. It's soft, stylish, and perfect for everyday wear, though if you're looking for something more fitted, you might want to size down or try another style.","R1QFLKWC3YZINQ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"13 people found this helpful","Nice t-shirt","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QFLKWC3YZINQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075ZZ7XKD","Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHX3CYF7AZKPKK2VEW2CMOK6FJFA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHX3CYF7AZKPKK2VEW2CMOK6FJFA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: XX-Large, Color: Gold (2-pack), Number of Items: 2","B075ZZ7XKD","Size","XX-Large","Color","Gold (2-pack)","Number of Items","2"

As a guy who's seen the stage show, once I went in with a healthy dose of skepticism, but came out genuinely impressed. They've taken a beloved classic and given it a visually stunning, emotionally resonant cinematic makeover.First off, the world of Oz is absolutely breathtaking. They've translated the stage magic into a sprawling, vibrant spectacle. It’s like stepping into a living painting, every scene bursting with color and detail. It’s a feast for the eyes, even for those of us who usually prefer our entertainment with a bit more… explosions.The story, as always, is a masterclass in nuanced storytelling. It's not just about good versus evil; it's about friendship, acceptance, and the power of perspective. They’ve captured the heart of the show perfectly, and even added some new layers that really enhance the experience.The performances are top-notch. They’ve brought these iconic characters to life with such depth and authenticity. The chemistry between Elphaba and Glinda is electric, and their vocal performances are simply stunning. They deliver those iconic songs with power and emotion, making you feel every note.Look, I get it. Musicals aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. But ""Wicked"" transcends genres. It’s a story that resonates with everyone, regardless of their musical preferences. It’s about being true to yourself, even when the world tells you that you're too different. And that's a message that everyone can get behind.They've done justice to the source material, and they’ve created a film that’s both entertaining and thought-provoking. It's a movie that you can enjoy with your friends, your family, or even by yourself. It’s a feel-good experience that leaves you with a smile on your face and a song in your heart. Trust me, even if you’re a die-hard action fan, you’ll find something to love in ""Wicked.""

As a little girl, no older than 4, the colors and singing reeled me into a life long love for the play — of course, nothing can make it better than the orginal cast. The next year, I was gifted the Wizard of Oz movie and of course Ruby slippers (because what 5 year old can go without), allowing me to further grow my love of the Oz world. Seeing the play again in 2013, I feel in love with Oz as a whole.When I heard in 2015 that there was talk of a movie version, I was a tad skeptical. By 2019, when I read the book version, I was very worried which way a movie version can go.With covid and working in healthcare, I looked no further into the movie until late 2022, when I heard that Ariana Grande had been casted as Glinda from a theatre friend. As a girl who grew up on Victorious and her music, I became excited for the future of the movie. Cynthia Erivio, I knew less about, only knowing her via The Greatest Showman and glimpses I saw of Harriet. By 2024, my skepticism waned, and like any Wicked enthusiast, I went to the theatre with mild unease, but came out with joy.The producers and actors/actresses were able to bring the wonders of Oz to tbe big screen. With action, color, glam, this is a must watch for all ages. It combines learning acceptance, the power of friendship, all the great teachings of the play into one. While I can admit, I’m not the world’s biggest fan of muscicals, this is one I will cherish time and time again.Even in the first few moment’s of the movie, it foreshadows the second act. Spoiler alert: I love the Easter eggs to the Wizard of Oz. With the well known songs of “Popular” and “Defying Gravity,” I felt a part of the world, especially when watching the 3d version. Who knew monkeys flying out the screen would give such a crazy jump scare? 😂But no more spoilers. I hope you and your families or friends enjoy.Please note, some parts may not be child friendly — just because I saw the play at 4 does not mean your child should. There is nothing inappropriate nor language, but it can be overwhelming and mildly violent with some more adult references.The physical DVD wise:The 4k dvd is “ehh” at best. The colors pop, but the sound vibrates every time a song plays, catching on major notes and ruining the show for me. I believe it’s just the dvd’s manufacturing, as playing the same version on MovieEverywhere does not lead to this annoying vibration/lagging. And yes, I did try three dvd player’s and multiple tv’s to verify it was not my ears — all player’s that are meant for 4k dvd’s. The non-4K DVD worked fine. If not for the DVD’s issue, I would have given 5 stars.","R1WM21NORUPH4Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","A One in a Million Masterpiece 🥰","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WM21NORUPH4Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DNLLBQHR","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEVSY7675ZGRPXEKSFEXZKU2PDVQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVSY7675ZGRPXEKSFEXZKU2PDVQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DNLLBQHR",,,,,,

I'm having it like I do most, which is 10 ounces of brewed water, a splash of cold water, 2% milk, Walmart French Vanilla creamer, and Hershey's Simply 5 chocolate syrup - which is their most expensive choice, as it doesn't use high fructose corn syrup. It tastes fine - but I'm NOT a finicky coffee drinker. I just try to buy and drink those pods I like to some degree, (not bitter) and is relatively inexpensive at .25 - .30 cents each. This meets those lax standards. Of course, if you're willing to pay 2 to 4 times that, (.50 to $1.00) you can get some very addictive coffee pods made by Starbuck's! My other habit is to buy cheap coffee in the can, and add some flavored coffee to it, and brew in a reusable pod w/ 12 ounces of water (a large cup). Those can get the cost down to about .15 cents for a large cup, before creamer, and (many claim) is better for the environment. When buying Amazon's brand, note that you have to make sure you're making a one-time purchase, and not regularly, through their Subscribe and Save (unless you want that, as the price is slightly lower). Apparently, I clicked that radio button once, to see the cost, didn't change it back, and didn't buy any whatsoever. But at some point I did save it the Save for Later Cart.

They would have got here 3 days earlier but there was a few days delay due to the weather I am guessing.I am pretty pleased with this purchase. These 12LB Pair Neoprene Amazon Basics Dumbbells are at a VERY affordable price in comparison to other weights around the internet. That must explain why these Amazon Basics Neoprene Pair Dumbbells have over 90,000 reviews averaging 4.8 stars out of 5 stars. These Amazon Basics Neoprene Pair Dumbbells truly are… the only value for your money online I would say. The quality seems to be there too. I would say… these are a GREAT purchase!The Black color Neoprene is… Black; the color is true. The Neoprene provides a comfortable grip for those people with softer hands and for people with rougher hands as well.I do not have a weight scale (I apologize everyone). So I am unable to verify the EXACT weight of both of these 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells. But I will say this… I am 32 years young, played football, served Active Duty in the U.S. ARMY, I am 5’9 and weigh in between 225-240lbs (around 215lbs during my time in the U.S. ARMY) and I have been strength training since I was 16 years old CONSISTENTLY and TRULY (I Love training). I have Benched  Pressed 335lbs, Deadlifted 455lbs for 3 reps, Squatted 655lbs, Dumbbell Pressed the 140lb Dumbbells, Leg Pressed 1,000lbs maybe a little more, and I have curled a little over 140lbs on the curl bar (two 45 plates one on each side and two 25lb plates one on each side). So I have some credibility in judging weights on how they feel without a scale. And I can truly say that these 12LB Pair Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells do feel around (if not true) to 12LBS. Because I was using 10LB Neoprene Dumbbells from Reebok for MONTHS! And I CAN FEEL THE SLIGHT WEIGHT INCREASE in comparison to the previous Reebok 10LB Neoprene Dumbbells; especially when I am doing light at home shoulder work (train shoulders safely for good health and longevity muscles break quicker than iron most times). And these Amazon Basics 12LB Neoprene Dumbbells feel GREAT and I really like them! I have the 20LB Pair Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells coming tomorrow (Wednesday January 3rd, 2023) I placed that order on Friday December 29th, 2023 and those ran out of stock and I am getting those this fast and quickly! -Impressive! So when they have these in stock, they come quickly! -AND FOR A GREAT TRULY UNBEATABLE PRICE! So purchase them while you are able to. If you want them, purchase them quick because they might be temporarily out of stock. But Amazon restocks them fairly quickly. As you can see from my review details on when I placed the order for mine and received mine in about one week timeframe. And that was with delays like: weather, and being temporarily out of stock.On to the size and how they feel in your hands (depending on hand size). I have fairly larger hands; almost 8 inches tall from my wrist, to the tip of my middle finger. And with my hands spread wide open, my hands measure 9 inches from the end of my thumbs, to the end of my pinky fingers. And when I grip these 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells I have a snug grip. These 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells in comparison to the 10LB Reebok Dumbbells that I was using are… “stubbier” I would say in comparison to the 10LB Reebok Dumbbells I was previously using (I purchased these Amazon Basics ones because they are an exact matching pair the Reebok ones were a mismatch). -BUT! Even though these 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are… “stubbier,” in comparison to the previous mismatched 10LB Reebok Dumbbells I was using. I still REALLY like these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells because they fill my hands, and there is no wasted space in between my hands and the handle of the 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells. -AND… the Amazon Basics ones match! So now I have EXACT weight distribution instead of constantly switching hands to even out the weight distribution in each arm due to the Reebok ones being a 10LB mismatch (their shape is different got mixed up sometime in the past). These 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are: compact, and they feel AT ONE with my body. There is no “slack” in the feeling when I use these 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbell’s.The hexagon pattern in these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are very nice as you would expect, and they stack very well when you store them after your workout. They can also make a good transportable dumbbells to workout with if you are road tripping somewhere and you want to have the opportunity to get in a quick workout, you can throw these in a duffle bag (a sturdy one) and take them with you somewhere to workout when you want to. I’m unsure about taking them with you on an airline; you may have to call the airlines for that clarification so you don’t risk getting them possibly confiscated, but if you are driving and you want to take these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells with you, you can do that!The white “12LB” labeling on these Black Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells (the 12LB versions) are easy to identify due to the good use of color contrast; the white colored numbering “12LB” on these Black Amazon Basics 12LB Dumbbells are easy to identify… and… that was redundant.As for the durability of these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells, I am confident; and I think you will feel confident that these will be able to withstand normal use in your workouts. And if you drop your weights (although safely controlling the weight down is a far wiser option) I am confident and you will feel confident that these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells WILL HOLD in the durability department.Thank You for reading my review of these GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells (PAIR)!Now if you will excuse me, I am going to workout with these now… and if you’re thinking about making the purchase as I was, I am confident that you will be satisfied and find value in your purchase so you can train better and more effectively and efficiently.Thank You again for reading my review of the Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells (PAIR)! God Bless You.UPDATE: Hi people! Today is Wednesday January 3rd, 2024 and I just received my Green 20LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Pair Dumbbells! THEY ARE SOLD AS A PAIR! And as I Love the 12LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells I also LOVE these 20LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells! THEY ARE SOLD AS A PAIR! And at a VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE! And the quality is FANTASTIC! Mine came with a slight scuff mark from something before I purchased and received it as my own; whatever that was.But I Love these 20LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells! They are Big compared to the other smaller Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells; not overly big, just… 20LBS big! They feel very nice in my larger hands I have nice comfortable room to grab onto and fill my hands. They stack very nice in place and won’t take up alot of room depending on how you stack and store them before your next workout / training session.I like how these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells have a underline that goes underneath the numbers so you don’t get confused if you are lifting 6 or 9 pound dumbbells. So I really appreciate Amazon putting that white underline underneath the numbers so you don’t get confused trying to identify if your 6 pound dumbbell is a 9 pound dumbbell and vice versa. I really like how clearly labeled the weight is on these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbell Pairs are. They are exactly like this: 12LB, 15LB, 20LB, etc: it makes identifying your weights alot easier and faster.I only intended to “just” get the 12LB Pair Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells. But… I like them so much because they are sold as a pair and that the price is SO AFFORDABLE I got the 20LB ones… and after I just received my 20LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells today (Wednesday January 3rd, 2024)… I went and just bought the 15LB pair as well for my at home shoulder training workouts and training sessions.Overall these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are a GREAT BUY! DO NOT WAIT! BUY THEM IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT IT! Because after you shop around these Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells are a GREAT DEAL! Very affordable in comparison to just 1 dumbbell from another place you might shop around for. And plus… the reviews and very high ratings speak for themselves.UPDATE: Hi everyone! I am writing this update today (Tuesday January 9th, 2024). I received my 15LB Pair Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells yesterday (Monday January 8th, 2024) and they arrived with the scheduled arrival time (Between 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM). And They are great! I like them. I don’t have a scale so I am unable to provide the exact weight to see if they are exactly 15LBS but they feel it though.These 15LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells I received are… “the most defective” out of the 3 Pairs I received. Very minor though, and I am going to share with you all what those 2 minor things are: The first minor defect is there are a few very tiny Neoprene holes that didn’t get filled in. You wouldn’t notice though unless you VERY CLOSELY inspected the product as I did. And the second minor defect I… “felt” was that one of the 15LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells in the handle has a… oval shaped feel, rather than a full round handle shape feel as all of my other Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells do. And that’s all. Still a good valuable purchase though. I’m not trippin too hard about it but I wanted to point those out to you.I already threw the box away, and I don’t feel like exchanging them for a NEW set of 15LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells. Who knows… maybe I should though since I am using these as a long term investment. Maybe I should just make it perfect. We’ll see.Other than that the hexagon shaped pattern is perfect! The grip feels good, I have a little more space innthe handle with the 15LB Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells kind of like the 20LB pair. Now I am straight for training, lifting, and exercising during the winter with good, safe, full, complete shoulder workouts and more during this cold season.","R2IT02ER3OGHWR","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CUfAgMkTL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81AXY44ITbL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XLKEGBmYL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814zNYivcAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P6kMCMO2L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y6G0W7mdL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wLBAsfzlL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wlj6O1CPL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ABIUJWg+L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P0I5TwswL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sS4HV-llL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615n49L7EUL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RuIoRRzWL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YHowb6jKL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Kp1vTvqUL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71l9VDbdZiL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+6dF8W9eL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sFQn2W4zL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81E87MKIr0L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KUUIQwkKL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kGDSCgbdL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813VrzstL+L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZDWz5TwwL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VYxPNtLcL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FDbjh651L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZG0UYEJ1L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71012+efMBL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71z2xUC0RAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81u3px2u39L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RBRpf9v0L._SY88.jpg","267 people found this helpful","I Purchased The: 12LB Pair, 15LB Pair, and 20LB Pair Amazon Basics Neoprene Dumbbells","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IT02ER3OGHWR/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01LR5RO5U","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AFAJBPTFMW6SD4TARNNQWNFVM64Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFAJBPTFMW6SD4TARNNQWNFVM64Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Style: 12 Pound, Pair","B01LR5RO5U","Style","12 Pound, Pair",,,,

The adjustable straps make it super easy to get the right fit, and they actually stay in place without leaking or slipping off, even with all the splashing and jumping around.One of the best features for me as a parent is the snap clasp in the back. It makes putting them on and taking them off so much easier—no more tugging them over their heads or accidentally pulling anyone’s hair. The kids love that part too. The goggles themselves are clear, don’t fog up, and seem really well made. We've used them several times now, and they still look and work like new.Overall, I’m really happy with this purchase. It’s hard to find one product that works for multiple ages, but these nailed it.

This fits different needs, but is still really really exceptional.If you're a gym rat just looking for *only* plain old bulk protein to take after workouts, or you reeeeeeallly take a lot of it, honestly I'd get a big giant tub of bulk powder from like muscle milk or optimum nutrition. The price is just too good to ignore, & plus you can add another scoop or two to double or triple the protein. You can't really beat it, other than taste.Speaking of taste, whether it's a pre-mix or powders, I've never, ever ever ever tasted a protein shake that tasted as good as this chocolate one. Dozens & dozens of brands over the decades, & the only one that comes close was the OG Muscle Milk recipe in the old tetra packs from like 15-20 years ago, before they were bought by Gatorade or whoever. This has NO right tasting as good as it does, with as little sugar, calories, & fat. PLUS having artificial sweeteners like stevia & sucralose. One reason I despise pre-made shakes, zero calorie & low sugar drinks is because I have a very strong detection of artificial sweeteners, but I can barely tell these are there. On top of that, 42 grams of protein in 14floz? I don't know what magic Fairlife did, but it's incredible.One thing I will say though, is if you're taking a protein drink for pretty much anything other than supplemental protein replacement, this doesn't offer too much else. The ""vitamins & minerals"" aren't too impressive, and though a high protein drink can make you feel full or satiated, calories & fat are important too. As stereotyped it is, something like Ensure has a really good blend of calories, fat, sugar, and a lot of vitamins. There is a reason it's used all over hospitals & nursing homes. Plus the Ensure ""Plus"" & ""Complete"" have 16g & 30g protein each, respectively. They don't taste as good as the Fairlife does, but they're actually not too bad, since they use actual sugar. However, those really are meant for convalescing & true meal replacement, not bulking & training.The only other downside is price really, at $40-45 for a 12 pack, these aren't cheap. However, when compared to a good alternative like optimum gold at about $25 for a 12 pack, you're getting almost double the protein in each drink from 24 to 42, and they're 14oz instead of 11oz, so you're getting 168oz compared to 132oz, which is like getting 3 more drinks worth. It's still a bit costly per bottle, as an Optimum Nutrition/Pure Protein/Premier Protein 11oz pre-made at $25 a 12pk will be a little over $2 each, & the Fairlife 12pk @ $45 is about $3.75 each. Still cheaper than if you went to pick one up at the gym or a gas station or something, a single would probably be $5-7, so there's value there in bulk. If it's worth it to you, that's up to your wallet.Another plus is they are SNAP/EBT eligible, so that's a massive W.If you take loads & loads & loads of protein every single day, and lugging a shaker with powder around isn't a problem, bulk powder is gonna be a LOT cheaper. However, if you only drink one every couple days, and don't want to deal with the blender/shaker hassle, and most importantly want the best tasting shake, this is it. This stuff is awesome, & I'll 1000% be trying the vanilla and strawberry as well. The chocolate is an easy 5 and worth trying.","ROWCSXUUN525D",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"35 people found this helpful","Probably the best","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROWCSXUUN525D/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01DDIRDZA","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGLZIAHP5B2HIAECJZ4DYXTTC6AA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLZIAHP5B2HIAECJZ4DYXTTC6AA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B01DDIRDZA",,,,,,

Of course that's natural, but there's still plenty you can do in your 30s onward to stay in great shape, and that's upping that protein. Okay, so I gotta say, these are probably the best bottled protein shakes I've ever had, and I've tried a good majority of them at different price ranges. This gets to the point. You get the 42 grams of protein at a reasonable price. Sometimes I replace breakfast or lunch (or both) with one of these shakes. I have them on a subscription so I get the discount and always have them available. The sugar content is fairly low, not really at a level that concerns me.

I remembered that the NY Times' Wirecutter had done a shapewear review so I found that article and decided to order the Shapermint high-waisted shaper. I ordered two sizes because I'm always surprised to find that I'm larger than I think I am, but thankfully I never even opened the larger one. I'm 5'2"" and 165 lbs and the M-L fit well. I took before and after pictures, but truthfully, it was hard to see any difference in the pictures so I haven't included them with this review. BUT the important thing is that I could see a difference in the mirror and the Shapermint will allow me to feel confident while wearing the dress. Does it give me my old figure back? No, but it does smooth me out with the top of the shaper coming up to my bra line and there is no thigh bulge where the shaper ends. All this while being surprisingly comfortable!  And the price is very reasonable.","R3UVFQ3VBWRQ8Q",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4 people found this helpful","Comfortable and Smoothing","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UVFQ3VBWRQ8Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YNY69X6","Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGSCVUNA7VDYKYBGBLWJBHEE7YFQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGSCVUNA7VDYKYBGBLWJBHEE7YFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: Medium-Large, Color: Nude","B07YNY69X6","Size","Medium-Large","Color","Nude",,

The shorts fit, but they didn't really provide the support expected. On the advice of a few, I purchased a size xs/s instead of m/l like I normally do.When I looked at the shorts, I thought there was no way that I was going to be able to fit my skinny-squishy 165lb body in those itty-bitty things. But I did. And without much effort at all.  They're tight, but they're not snatching my waist like they're supposed to. Everything is smoothed out. No bulges. And I can breathe, but it didn't shape my stomach. My stomach is still pooching out like it did before. There's just smooth flub-blub now instead of multiple flub-blubs and no muffin top (which is nice).I sat down on the bed to see if it was possible to still breathe (it was) and I looked at the package. On the back of the package it says ""Plus-size black small"" and it now makes sense why I am able to wear it.I'm 5'11. 165lbs. All of my weight is in my stomach, hips, and thighs. I wear a size 10-12 in jeans.Plus-sized clothing is made specifically to accommodate a body type that is beautifully voluptuous. Plus-sized clothing is labeled ""16W"" or ""16 curvy"" fur example.  The W or curvy indicating that it will fit a fuller figured individual. I know there's not a small in plus-size, but I think I've figured it out nonetheless:I have a friend that wears a size 14 curvy which is another way to tell the shopper that this product is constructed differently from a size 14 regular. The curvy or the W are constructed in a way that allows a fuller figure to settle comfortably unlike the regular that would be far too tight and constricting in the waiste, knees, and calves. Anyway...I checked on Amazon and found a plus-size Shapermint, high waisted shaper shorts that can be purchased in size S-3xl. These shorts are made like the curvy or W to accommodate curves that a woman who wore a regular small would not have. I believe the seller may have accidentally shipped a plus-sized garment when the purchaser wanted a regular rather than plus. And I think that this is why some buyers are talking about sizing down while others are describing being swallowed by a boa constrictor and not being able to breathe, or move, or sit.Maybe if I had a regular small then I'd be complaining about that, too because, trust me, I may be skinny-squishy but I haven't been able to fit into a small anything since 9th grade.

Functionally, it only gets one star because more than half of the K-pods do not work at all or only a little amount of coffee gets through the pod. That leaves a very, very weak or non-coffee taste.

Love that I can order it especially during these winter months we end up snowed in, not having to risk it bc I can’t go without coffee was a huge plus. Upon receiving it I figured I’d treat myself to an extra latte to try it out. I’m in no way exaggerating when I tell you I was shocked speechless. Speechless bc I couldnt stop sipping it in disbelief of the euphoria I found with every gulp. It was so aromatic with a full body taste with ZERO bitterness and bite. It’s so hard to find a good full bodied roast without any bite these days yet it’s both strong and smooth. It reminded me somewhat of chock full o nuts brand bc it had that smooth nutty taste but not one you’d notice if you weren’t trying to grasp each note of the flavor. I usually drink Gevalia Colombian but after trying this especially bc you can’t beat it being both cheaper and better, I’ll never buy anything but. In fact I have an order on the way but got a pack of gevalia to hold me over and it was such a downgrade so I’m counting down the days for my second order to arrive, if you’re contemplating just try it. You will in no way regret it and on the plus side you’ll be saving money when coffee prices are going to continue rising. It’s the best roast I’ve tried and I’m very picky when it comes to coffee. Very simple to use you can’t go wrong. I use 2oz shot worth of water through my kcup and I do that twice so I have 4 oz from 2 kcups as the base in my latte and froth a combination of half milk and half creamer of choice in the frother up to the max line and it makes a better latte than I can buy every single morning, afternoon, and evening.","R2YTHC87M688J5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"27 people found this helpful","Jaw dropping quality","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YTHC87M688J5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B079V8CKDM","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFUIQBLGDUKETR76MGO5VAEW5FUQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFUIQBLGDUKETR76MGO5VAEW5FUQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Flavor Name: Colombian, Size: 100 Count (Pack of 1)","B079V8CKDM","Flavor Name","Colombian","Size","100 Count (Pack of 1)",,

I recently picked up a 24-pack of **Pure Life Purified Water** in 8 fl oz bottles, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer.### **Perfect Size for On-the-Go Hydration**First off, the 8-ounce size is fantastic. It’s small enough to easily slip into my bag, lunchbox, or even my kids' backpacks. I’ve tried various bottled waters in the past, but I love how these mini bottles are perfectly portioned. They’re just enough to quench my thirst without feeling like I’m carrying around an entire gallon of water. Plus, they're lightweight, so I never feel weighed down.I also appreciate the resealable cap. It’s super convenient since I don’t have to finish the whole bottle in one go (especially when I’m running errands). If I don’t finish it, I can easily close it and save it for later, which is perfect for me and my kids when we're out and about.### **Clean, Refreshing Taste**The water itself tastes clean and refreshing. No weird aftertaste or overly processed flavor like some other bottled waters I’ve tried. It’s simple, crisp, and just what I need when I’m thirsty. I’m also glad there are no calories or sweeteners – sometimes I just want pure, unflavored hydration. The added minerals (calcium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium sulfate) give it a subtle, pleasant taste that makes it feel just a bit more satisfying than plain water.### **Great for Kids and Healthier Choices**I can’t stress enough how perfect these bottles are for my kids. I throw them in their school lunches, and they’re the ideal size for little hands to carry around. They love how easy it is to drink from, and I love that they’re getting something healthier than sugary juices or sodas. It's such a relief to know they’re hydrated without having to worry about them ingesting unnecessary calories or sweeteners.### **Convenient and Easy to Stock Up**The 24-pack is great for stocking up. We go through water pretty quickly, and it’s nice to have a case of these small bottles in the pantry. I can grab a few at a time and stash them wherever I need – in my car, my office, or the fridge. It takes up little space, and I don’t have to constantly run out to buy more, which is a bonus. Plus, the price is really reasonable for the quality of water you’re getting.### **A Few Minor Issues**One small downside I’ve noticed (and it’s not a deal-breaker) is that a couple of bottles in my pack seemed to have a slight leak when I first opened them. It wasn’t a huge issue, but it was a bit annoying. I haven’t had it happen with every bottle, but it’s something to be aware of. Still, the quality of the water itself is top-notch, so I can overlook that small inconvenience.### **Final Thoughts**All in all, I’m really happy with my purchase of the Pure Life 8 fl oz bottles. The size is perfect for me and my family, it tastes great, and I feel good about choosing it over sugary drinks. It’s easy to store, convenient to carry, and a healthy hydration option. I’ve been drinking these bottles regularly now, and it’s become a part of my daily routine. If you're looking for a portable, no-fuss water option, this is definitely worth checking out!","RJHDXSV5FLQ7A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3 people found this helpful","Great purified water delivery at doorstep if dont wanna opt for supermarket","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJHDXSV5FLQ7A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00091S3K4","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGJM3ETFUQ5HZRULGJWBR2CHRLDQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJM3ETFUQ5HZRULGJWBR2CHRLDQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Flavor Name: Purified Water, Size: 8 Fl Oz (Pack of 24)","B00091S3K4","Flavor Name","Purified Water","Size","8 Fl Oz (Pack of 24)",,

Another thing I noticed was that because it made my mid sections sweat so much, it also made me break out.

It for sure works and does what it's supposed to but the effects are not long lasting and all it did was make me sweat and then broke me out.

All the cast are set up really well in a film that confidently and competently rolls out the exposition in a natural manner. When the horror part happens, it is also really well-paced, especially when it comes to the action, and has some appropriately eerie and eye-catching parts. I'm rather pleased that this takes a common supernatural threat (I'm not mentioning it if you haven't seen the second trailer yet), and looks at it from more of a ""mysticism"" lens.The movie does a wonderful job of weaving together messages and story. Since this is in the Jim Crow south, of course racism and the treatment of Afican Americans is a definite component, but it never feels like this is a movie focusing on trauma, but is about the people living their lives and a testament to black culture. When it comes to main messages in this, I'm not going to spoil anything as part of the joy of watching this is being made to think about what the movie is trying to say.Excellent casting all around in this. No surprise to anyone, but Michael B. Jordan gives a terrific performance. He does a great job of making each of the twins separate characters with separate personalities, storylines and wants for each. Musician and acting newcomer Miles Caton also gives a really solid performance as the Smokstack twins' cousin, musician Sammie Moore, a guy who loves his music and looks up to his more dangerous cousins. Caton gives a very real performance, and is sort of the core of the film.Jack O'Connell is also a lot of fun as the main villain Remmick. Director/writer Ryan Coogler (Black Panther/Creed/Fruitvale Station) could've gone with a one note monster with him, but he is surprisingly affable and three-dimensional (while also being an uncomfortable threat when the scary stuff happens), and his main goal may surprise you.Wonderful cinematography (including three REALLY well shot moments that steal the show). The movie is shot in a way I'd describe as ""stark"" color. Not darkly lit, but it has a harshness to it. Coogler and the cinematographer and editor do a solid job of having Jordan act opposite himself. The threats in this look appropriately off-putting.Music is a real focal point of the movie, and Sinners makes great use of songs and a stand-out score by Ludwig Goransson.The one thing about this film that may not work for some people is that the introduction is very long. It suitably sets up the people and place, but one could get bored.Highly recommended. This is one of those movies where everything works and really drags you in.  This is one of those rare horror movies like The Menu or The Substance that transcends being merely just horror.","R1KOK0TDQBRLI3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"41 people found this helpful","Excellent movie","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KOK0TDQBRLI3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F3QYVK1N","Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEECFYRSDPYS4WNWXWOX3T46LRXA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEECFYRSDPYS4WNWXWOX3T46LRXA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F3QYVK1N",,,,,,

I use the larger cubes for jeans and sweaters, the medium ones for shirts and dresses, and the smaller ones for undergarments, socks, and accessories. There’s even a great shoe bag and laundry bag included, which keeps clean and dirty items separated.The quality is impressive—lightweight yet durable, with sturdy zippers and breathable mesh panels that let you see what’s inside without having to unzip everything. They fit beautifully in both carry-on and checked luggage, maximizing space and keeping everything neatly compressed and wrinkle-free.Packing and unpacking have never been this stress-free. Instead of rummaging through a chaotic suitcase, I just pull out the cube I need. It’s a total time-saver and helps me stay organized throughout the entire trip.If you travel at all, this set is a must-have. It's a small investment that makes a big difference.

I looked into the packing cubes, but some of them are expensive and some organizational tools just don’t work for me and I didn’t want to spend the money to find out it didn’t workI also tend to pack right up to the 50 pound limit so I didn’t want heavy packing cubesI’ve had these for a while now and they’ve been on airplane trips and trips to the beach for a long weekends. I adore themThey are not stiff so they are a little bit more forgiving if you overpack them and they don’t hold up their sides very well  This is very fine for me. It might be not fine for someone else.My husband, bought some of his own.  he spent more money and his were stii and they also had heavy metal company tags on them. They weighed too much.  He ended up not liking them because the set was just all square ones and never used them and they’re probably going to the thrift storeThis set, On the other hand, had a multiple of sizes. I Use the sock bag to put all my hair items in. I put in a mirror And various hair clips and scrunchies and barrettes. Just one of each.I put my shower shoes in the pocket of the shoe bag, And I put all my shower items in the large section, Shampoo, my back scrubber my razor anything that goes into the shower goes thereI use one of the Medium bag for my bedside bag. I put a nightgown and bed socks into it  I put a drawstring bag with all my CPAP accessories in it. And then I put the toiletry bag as well in it  Inside the toiletry bag are my cordsOn the bottom of it vitamin box. My outlet surge protector because if you have a CPAP and electronic devices, you always need extra plugsIn the pockets, I put Reading  glasses for nighttime, Lotion, lip, balm, cuticle oil, etcIn the front pockets, I put my cords and my camera chargerOK, this might seem like a lot of detail, but this is why it’s importantThe shower has a handle on top the minute I get where I’m going. I take it by the handle and in the bathroom and everything is ready to go.I take my bedside place in the nightstand and I have everything ready to go, i unpack my cords, Plug everything in and I’m ready to recharge and set up my CPAPI put the underwear bag that I also put in deodorant, sanitary pads, etc And place that where I’m going to get dressed in the morningI use one of the other bags for all my swim gearI put my swimsuit, my cover-up, My suntan lotion, Sunburn cream, Water wallet, Water shoesetc.When I’m ready to go to the pool, I just open it up get dressed and I’m good to goIf we’re tropical and we’re touring around, I might just throw the whole thing in the trunk of the car because sometimes after you’re done, you might find a beach you might want to swim in.So well, I hoped these are just make my suitcase more organized.  They actually have made me so much more organized.When I return home, I clean out my suitcase and after doing laundry, I repack them so that I’m almost ready to go in a moments. All I have to do is throw my clothes in my suitcase. It’s very helpful if you have elderly parents or other reasons you might need to pack quickly, like a traveling jobI would s get these again,  in fact, I’m thinking of getting another set.If you’re new to packing cubes, I would recommend these. They are lightweight and they are good economic way to try them out. It’s nice that they come in a multitude of colors.I made a list of everything that goes in them a little little business cards and laminated them and attached them to the zippers so that it makes it super easy to pack whether I am home or I am packing up at my destination so I don’t forget anything.","RLI6APHTVMAIG",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"190 people found this helpful","Sometimes cheaper is better!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLI6APHTVMAIG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08S35399Y","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AHRHOQFD4RFUNC3NCOF6WCXZB4DA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRHOQFD4RFUNC3NCOF6WCXZB4DA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: White and Pink Stripe, Size: 8 Set","B08S35399Y","Color","White and Pink Stripe","Size","8 Set",,

When I first got them I was skeptical as to how long they would last since the fabric seemed a little flimsy but I have had zero problems. The zippers have been sturdy and smooth and the fabric has held up even though i fill them completely (and I do mean completely) full each time. I can pack jeans, 5 tops, pajamas, and workout clothes in one of the larger cubes, even in winter. I also use the zipper pouch a lot for holding charging cords, earbuds, and other random items. I initially used the shoe bag a couple of times but I don't find it very helpful. The laundry bag is too small to use for laundry and so far I haven't bothered using it for anything else. But it might be useful in another capacity. I used the toiletry bag a couple of time for socks and underwear but I just don't care for it so I really never use it. I have Travelon mesh pouches that I love for that and many other purposes. The actual cubes and the zipper bag are the pieces I use all the time. I usually travel at least once a month so these have gotten a lot of use. I do really like the mesh top so I can see what's in the cube and I like that the fabric can be easily wiped off if something gets on it. I also love that the top unzips all the way around. Makes packing so much easier. Packing cubes have been a game changer for me and have just made traveling so much easier. These aren't the highest quality but they work just fine and the price is right. Great place to start if you're just beginning to use packing cubes and want to see what all the fuss is about. I might upgrade in the future but for now these work great.","R2XEKJEVUHWJTF",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"26 people found this helpful","Used them 3.5 years and still going","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XEKJEVUHWJTF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08S35399Y","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFY3IDRHIE6GOQVVWGY3AS267I3A","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFY3IDRHIE6GOQVVWGY3AS267I3A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Teal, Size: 8 Set","B08S35399Y","Color","Teal","Size","8 Set",,

The zips are durable, smooth and easy to use (unlike the zips on my previous set). The striped pink pattern is cute and is satisfying with my pink suitcase.The range of sizes is great, and plenty of cubes come in the set but I would’ve loved 1 extra for my own personal needs and preferences. The cubes are nice and deep/tall so good for “large” 77cm cabin suitcases”. You can fit so much in the cubes, yet despite being a notorious over-packer, I rarely fill the cubes themselves. I usually end up stacking them all/most on one side of my large suitcase and using the other side of the suitcase for my toiletry bag, shoes, slippers, etc.I ordered a few different sets ranging from £10-£15ish. While the Bagail were the most expensive set I looked at, they felt the best quality and were the best size and range. I’m happy with my choice and would definitely recommend them.

Yes, every night.  The reason is that I cannot afford a decent new mattress and before switching to an air mattress, I had used mattresses.  Most developed ""sink holes"" and those who sleep on an older mattress know what I mean - a spring or something inside has shifted and that spot...well, it's a dip that you have to figure out how to avoid when sleeping.  But the basic reason is because I am an older lady that lives alone and when I have moved, I have moved myself so as not to bother people.  I have mostly flat pack furniture so I can break it down and move it myself.  Having an air mattress fits right in with that ease of moving my own stuff.  The IDOO I had was a great deal, though I had last had a King Coil 22"" that I really liked EXCEPT for their ""pillow"" area (the part at the head is inclined and that bothered me since I am an ""arm sleeper"" - put one arm up under my pillow, under my head and hang it off the bed).  Other than that part King Coil is a great air mattress bed.  Now for this Intex - I have had a couple of different Intex items and find they make quality stuff - first was a smaller, rectangular pool that wasn't too hard to set up (but I did need a friend to help with putting it up) and I currently have their inflatable loveseat that unfolds to become a bed.  It's a nice extra piece of furniture/bed, but wish it had the internal pump which it doesn't.  Still, it is a serviceable spare seating and sleeping piece that can be put up quickly enough.  NOW, for this bed - back to my 22"" height and I am SO HAPPY with that part of it.  When you are older, getting UP off something is harder than scooting down off that same thing!  Meaning that I have no problem getting on a bed (no matter what the height), but in the morning, when I'm groggy and not 100%, trying to push myself up off the 18"" wasn't horrible, but it wasn't fun at all.  With this Intex 22"" queen, my feet dangle just a bit off the floor and pushing myself off and DOWN is just so much easier.  I was also relieved that the pump is at the top (or could be the bottom, depending on how you orient the bed) as my outlet is at that spot on the wall behind the bed.  The IDOO had the pump on the side so the cord had to be put up under the bed...I didn't like that.  This Intex, like all the air mattresses with an internal pump, it inflates (and deflates) very quickly.  Around 5 minutes.  What's easy is taking down an air mattress - most of them come with a carry case as this one did - and if you flip the sides in, then do a fourths fold up, it will fit in the bag and isn't too terribly heavy even for me to carry.  The IDOO developed a leak and instead of trying to patch it, as I have slept on it for about 2 years, I deflated it, put it in the bag it came with and threw it away.  This Intex, I had it out of the box an fully inflated in less than 10 minutes.  Made the bed and laid down on it - aaahhhh!  So, if you are in need of a spare bed for overnight guests on occasion OR you have had it with your lumpy old ""regular"" mattress and having sticker shock over the memory foam, purple, pillow top and other replacements, you might want to try an air mattress.  Even if you only use it long enough to save enough money for one of those $500-$1000 mattress, this $75 mattress will allow you to sleep well, night after night after night.","R197PQXOO9YKSB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"342 people found this helpful","From an IDOO 18"" to this Intex 22"" queen air mattress","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R197PQXOO9YKSB/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0869HGSVL","Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023",,,"amzn1.account.AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBG3KK74IKWJNQVMQAGVBWJ7FAQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Style: 22"", Color: Grey, Size: Queen","B0869HGSVL","Style","22""","Color","Grey","Size","Queen"

There is no indent for the bottom of the elastic to go around. I only had to fix them once in 8 nights. I slept alone, so I can't say how it would be with two.

It's packed with natural ingredients like green tea extract, caffeine, and electrolytes, which make me feel energized and focused without the jitters or crash. I’ve noticed I can power through long days at work or intense gym sessions without feeling drained.The 12-pack is also a great value — I always have a can ready to go when I need it, whether it's a mid-morning pick-me-up or an afternoon refresh.

I've been careful about not letting the battery get fully discharged because this can shorten battery life. I'm also mindful of disconnecting once fully charged. I believe it was after the 3rd charging one of the 2 went from showing 4 bars (out of 4) on the charge indicator to 0 power in a very short time. I recharged it again and used it today. Same thing happened even faster this time. When I connected it to the charger, it showed to be 75% charged.The other one is still working great. I only use one of the 6 different types/intensities of light these provide but I like them so much better than my old AAA battery powered ones. Just a bit of a bummer that 1 of the 2 is already having problems.For comfort and functionality I give them 5 stars however because 1 of the 2 is already having issues, I have to say 4 stars.

These pods are great as a daily alternative. A regular shot of espresso is typically 1 fluid ounce (a doppio is two) and costs around $1.25 at Starbucks. These pods cost about $1.30 but each pod makes 7.8 ounces, almost a full cup. So at Starbucks you're paying $1.25 per ounce where here you are paying $0.16 per ounce and that's a big difference. The coffee comes out just as tasty as it does at the coffee shop with its signature creamy head. Granted, you might not want to drink the equivalent of about 8 shots of espresso, but if you are combining it with stuff to make it a latte or something (which I occasionally do) it's great. You can also buy pods that make a lesser amount. You do have to shell out the money for the actual Nespresso machine, but it certainly pays for itself over time compared to swinging through the coffee shop every day. You can return the pods to recycle them (I'm sort of a tree hugger) which is a bonus.Pros* Great taste and texture* Great value compared to commercial coffee* Recyclable podsCons* You need to buy a Nespresso machine to use them","R2F5HDF19RCRZT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5 people found this helpful","Great Taste and Great Value","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F5HDF19RCRZT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N05APQY","Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AH3CE5725WLCTFM22TJSQYW35WWQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH3CE5725WLCTFM22TJSQYW35WWQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Flavor Name: Intenso, Size: 30 Count (Pack of 1)","B01N05APQY","Flavor Name","Intenso","Size","30 Count (Pack of 1)",,

If you’re a fan of a smooth, mild cup of coffee, this is definitely worth trying.Taste:The Solelio Mild Roast offers a beautifully smooth and well-balanced flavor profile. It’s not too strong or too weak—just the right amount of flavor to start your day off with a satisfying cup. There’s a subtle hint of nuttiness and a slight natural sweetness that really makes it enjoyable. I’ve found it perfect for those mornings when I want something gentle but still rich and flavorful.Convenience:I absolutely love the convenience of the Nespresso system, and these pods make my mornings so much easier. The 30-count box ensures I’m stocked up for a while, and with the Vertuo machine, each pod brews perfectly every time. The capsules are easy to use, and there’s no mess or fuss with grounds—just pop it in, and the machine does the rest. Plus, they brew a generous 7.8 oz of coffee, which is ideal for my morning cup.Quality:Nespresso never disappoints when it comes to quality, and these capsules are no exception. The coffee is consistently fresh, and the aroma when brewing is incredible. The pods are sealed well, keeping the coffee inside fresh until you’re ready to brew. I’ve tried other mild roasts, but none have had the same depth of flavor and smoothness as the Solelio.Sustainability:Another reason I love Nespresso is their commitment to sustainability. These pods are recyclable, which makes me feel better about my purchase, knowing that I’m supporting an eco-conscious brand.Overall:If you enjoy a smooth, mild roast that’s full of flavor but not overwhelming, the Nespresso Capsules Vertuo Solelio is a fantastic choice. The convenience of the pods, paired with the delicious taste and Nespresso’s quality, makes it a standout in my daily coffee routine. I will definitely be buying this again and recommending it to fellow coffee lovers!","R1W4FP12KZB26G",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7 people found this helpful","Perfect Morning Brew - Smooth, Flavorful, and Convenient!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1W4FP12KZB26G/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N05APQY","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AH23XRS5RPAQRA5A7ZFFPKOLD5DQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH23XRS5RPAQRA5A7ZFFPKOLD5DQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Flavor Name: Solelio, Size: 30 Count (Pack of 1)","B01N05APQY","Flavor Name","Solelio","Size","30 Count (Pack of 1)",,

My skin is so dry, I've always used just use a splash of water on it in the morning.  I started using these strictly because said condition makes my back pain much worse at the end of the day. I wear lipstick all the time and don't use very much makeup: just a skin serum and moisturizer and tinted moisturizer with SPF, occasional blush and no eye makeup. I particularly like the fact that these have no scent and unlike what some find, I don't feel any greasy residue on my face after use.  I also like that they are biodegradable. Sometimes, particularly in the Winter, my facial skin will actually hurt from being dry and the last time it happened, I stopped using these but saw no difference.

My son just turned 6, and the one thing he REALLLLLLLLY wanted was a “Stanley.” I can’t believe kids that young are already so amped up about a trendy-expensive water bottle. I don’t even have one! 😒I looked at all the different styles. I know he prefers a straw cup vs an open mouth style. I also know he’s really forgetful and might not remember to bring it home if it doesn’t fit easily in his backpack,  so one with a giant side handle probably wouldn’t work. I found this one and fell in love with the size (20oz) and the cool top handle that flips down. It’s totally a “big boy cup.” The straw is perfect for him, too.It’s a big change going from his lightweight & easy to use ZAK cups to something so heavy-duty, but he loves it! Just keep in mind these cups get super heavy once ice and liquids are added. His entire backpack was weighed down! Ice is staying frozen the majority of the day as long as there’s at least 4 cubes; one or two melted within a couple hours.Is it spill-proof?? Only if the straw is shut. If it’s open, it leaks EVERYWHERE.I’d say this will work ok as a “home” cup for younger kids, although they may need help opening the straw (it’s pretty stiff).

I had on my crossbody purse, a phone in hand (sometimes) and just carried this water bottle like nothing. It didn't bother me or annoy me a single bit. I attribute this to the large handle, proper size and good weight of the bottle. It is a tilt and drink water bottle, in case you're wondering.So, great quality. Perfect water capacity to carry, ice stayed (as always with Stanley), it is super easy to open because you can kind of twist it by the handle to begin and truly a great value for your money.

This medium looks a bit loose fitting, but there’s still some form to it. Maybe order one size down if you want a tight, more form fitted t-shirt.

The fit is perfect – not too tight, not too loose, and the classic cut is flattering without being too boxy. The V-neck is just the right depth, giving it a casual yet polished look. They hold up well after many washes, maintaining their shape and softness.What I really appreciate is the quality of these shirts. They’re half the price of other name-brand options, but the quality is just as good, if not better. They’re versatile, easy to style with jeans, skirts, or shorts, and they can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.If you're looking for high-quality, affordable, and comfortable t-shirts, I highly recommend these.

All in all, I've had the DVD, the standard blu-ray and now the 4K disc, and I'm very happy that I made the choice to upgrade.  Of course, it's miles ahead of the DVD.

We found a new solar system, dozens of planets and hundreds of moons. Each one terraformed, a process taking decades, to support human life. To be new Earths. The central planets formed The Alliance, ruled by an interplanetary parliament. The Alliance was a beacon of civilization. The savage outer planets were not so enlightened, and refused Alliance control. [At about here, you realize that this is sounding too much like a political ad, or maybe indoctrination. Then, sure enough, you see the speaker, a teacher standing in front of her young charges. She continues:]The war was devastating. But the Alliance's victory over the Independents insured a safer universe. And now, everyone can enjoy the comfort and enlightenment of true civilization.""One of the students is the young River Tam. She tells the teacher why the Independents would have rebelled: ""We meddle ... People don't like to be meddled with. We tell them what to do. What to think. Don't run. Don't walk. We're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right.""It's not just the plot and acting of ""Serenity"" that are excellent. It is the way the story is told; how it unfolds. First the disembodied voice, which turns into the teacher, which turns into a memory of the now 17 year-old River the subject of terrible experiments, which turns into an archive video being watched by The Operative. And this all happens before the opening credits!The archive video is of Simon Tam rescuing his little sister, River, from the Alliance laboratory. And now the two are on the run from the Alliance, aboard the Serenity, a Firefly class transport ship. Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds was a Brown Coat, an Independent squashed by the Alliance. Now he's trying to make a living smuggling and salvaging, on the ship he named after the Plains of Serenity, the last great battle of the failed war of independence.It is a hard way to make a living. As Mal tells the unhappy Simon, ""I put this crew together with the promise of work, which the Alliance makes harder every year. Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to ship about at all. This job goes south, there well may not be another. So here's us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me and I won't push you.""The themes of ""Serenity"" are universal, sometimes troubling. The dialogue is snappy. The humor is great and frequently campy. Our first view of the ship Serenity shows it in trouble. The pilot says, ""This landing is going to get pretty interesting.""The Captain looks at him: ""Define interesting.""Pilot: ""Oh God Oh God, we're all going to die?""I saw ""Serenity"" in the movie theater before we even knew of the prequel TV series, ""Firefly"". Now, we have both for home viewing, and I strongly recommend watching the TV series first, if possible. The movie does stand alone and gives you sufficient background. But the experience will be richer if you have seen the TV series first.DVD:  Firefly: The Complete SeriesBlu-ray:  Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]BONUS EXTRAS on the Serenity [Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy]:To access the digital copy of the movie, you need to download from a Universal Studios site, using the activation code included.

Mr. Universe's Compendium (U-Control on Blu-Ray) This is background and added information on organizations, weaponry and people in the Serenity universe.5.  Alliance Database (Blu-ray)6.  Commentary by writer/director Joss Whedon (DVD) I enjoyed re-watching the movie with Whedon's commentary. Joss talks about needing a villain. ""Somebody who would believe so strongly in what he was doing, that he would do anything. The exact opposite, of course, of the hero. In casting Chiwetel Ejidfor, we found the perfect person because he brings such depth and soulfulness and regret to everything he does.""Whedon says that he likes to cast comedians in drama roles. Comedy, he says, ""is the hard one."" If the actor can do comedy, then they can do drama.7.  Deleted Scenes (17 minutes) Interesting - one deleted scene showed the Operative researching Mal. He finds out that the Battle of Serenity had a 68% casualty rate for the Independents. Soldiers like Mal kept fighting for 2 weeks after the generals surrendered.8.  Outtakes (6 minutes)9.  ""Future History: The Story of Earth That Was"" (10 minutes) Joss Whedon tells how he came up with this version of the future, which is supposed to be 500 years from now. For example, there are two universal languages used, English and Chinese. In Joss's imagined future, these two superpowers merged when Earth set out to colonize.It's also interesting how he ""chose"" his hero: ""I just wanted to tell a story about people who are living in space, but not living in grandeur. And not living in great portent, but were more the fringe people. People that the Enterprise would have blown right past and never noticed.""And the hero's background: ""There's very little American fiction about the people who won the [Civil] war, about the North. The people we all like to be identified with, we're all interested in, is the South, because we love losers.""10.  ""What's in a Firefly"" (10 minutes) Fascinating look at how they worked scenes, such as the mule skip chase scene after the beginning bank robbery. Both CG and visual effects people explain how it was done.11. ""Re-lighting the Firefly"" (25 minutes, from 2005) The story of how Joss Whedon and others pulled together a film to tell the story that was left unfinished in the prematurely cancelled TV series. Commentators include Whedon and most of the ""Firefly"" cast. The most memorable moment was the San Diego ComicCon, after the show's cancellation and before the movie was finished. On the last half of the last day of the convention, 5,000 people showed up to see Josh and the cast.12. Joss Whedon Introdution (6 minutes) This is Whedon's introduction to a draft of the movie (not the final cut).Excellent, excellent film. The perfect example of the Space Cowboy movie!Happy Reader","R1O85DEOVZHADT","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Cp8kALGvL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"27 people found this helpful","BluRay/DVD/Digital Version of ""Serenity"", One of the Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1O85DEOVZHADT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F6BL4FFC","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2012",,,"amzn1.account.AFSIVZMMUEWXWTBFVJSFRIPRYMKA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFSIVZMMUEWXWTBFVJSFRIPRYMKA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F6BL4FFC",,,,,,

The characters can be seen as dialectic interlocutors representing different shades of morality.  This film is definitely among the more unique in our time.  It is as exciting as Indiana Jones, but is layered with deep philosophical complexities and moral ambiguities that many modern art house films don't even get quite right.As most people know, this film grew out of a short-lived series called Firefly, which, admittedly, I didn't know about before this film but have since watched in its entirety.  It is set in the future, in a post-war Reconstruction-esque Era where several worlds are run by the Alliance, a Sino-American, culturally fused mega-government that is, after all, just trying to make a better world.  The numerous system of worlds governed by the Alliance have forced them to spread their presence thin, leaving wiggle room for fringe settlers to live by their own laws (or lack thereof), similar to the American frontier era.Malcolm Reynolds is captain of the Serenity, a firefly class space vessel that is as iconic as the Millennium Falcon or the Black Pearl.  He fought for the browncoats, a resistance group who fought against the Alliance in the Unification War.  I'd coin the term ""vicarious schizophrenic"" just for Mal.  He's that complicated a character!  For the crew with which Mal has surrounded himself, I would make the argument, are a complex of Mal's many manifested personalities:Zoe - the Spartan who never diverts from her sense of purpose.Wash - the light-hearted adventurous pirate, filled with wanderlust.Kaylee - the suppressed inner child, innocent but adaptable and capable.Jayne - the churlish brigand, always calculating his advantages in any situation.Simon Tam - a man of moral purpose with a deep hatred for the Alliance, who abandoned a potentially comfortable life to resist the Alliance, who victimized his sister.River Tam - an otherwise gifted individual, twisted into something dark by the Alliance.Shepherd Book - warrior/preacher searching for cosmic purpose, who explores a realm where Mal himself won't venture, but who comes to teach Mal that belief doesn't necessarily have to involve something spiritual.Inara - a high class courtesan and Mal's soul mate, whom he petulantly alienates (implying Mal's self-hatred).The dialogue in this movie rivals some of the best I've ever seen on film.  It delves so deeply into the fabric of humanity and all of its moral dilemmas.  Here are a few examples (disclaimers: I did my best to be exact.  I've only seen this movie three times, so please forgive any inaccuracies):(my personal favorite!)Mal: Half of writing history is hiding the truth.(while experiencing a rough landing)Mal: Just get us on the ground!Wash: That part will happen pretty definitely!(before the payroll robbery)Mal: I don't plan on any shooting taking place on this job.Jayne: Yeah, but what you plan and what takes place ain't exactly been similar.(Simon protesting River's involvement in the payroll robbery)Simon: Do you understand what I've gone through to protect River from the Alliance?Mal: I do.  It's a fact we here have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves.Simon: Are you threatening me?Mal: I look out for me and mine. That don't include you unless I conjure it does.  Now you stuck a thorn in the Alliance's paw.  That tickles me a bit.  But it also means I have to step twice as fast to avoid them.  And that means turning down plenty of jobs.  Even honest ones.  Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to slip about at all.  This job goes south, there well may not be another.  So here is us, on the raggedy edge.  Don't push me, and I won't push you.(during the payroll robbery)Mal: I see a head rise, violence is going to ensue. Probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we're after here is not yours. So, let's have no undue fuss.(after rescuing Inara from the Operative)Inara: This isn't a war, Mal.  You came to that training house looking for a fight.Mal: I came looking for you.Inara: I just want to know who I'm dealing with.  I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.Mal: I start fighting a war, I guarantee you'll see something new.(after realizing the Alliance is hunting River Tam)Shepherd: You have a plan?Mal: What, hiding ain't a plan?(Later in that conversation)Mal: I could've left her there.  I had an out.  Hell, I had every reason in the `verse to haul anchor.Shepherd: it's not your way, Mal.Mal: I have a way?  Is that better than having a plan?(before the story's climax)Mal: You all got on this boat for different reasons, but you all come to the same place.  So now I'm asking more of you than I have before.  Sure as I know anything, I know this.  They will try again. Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean.  A year from now.  Maybe ten.  They'll swing back to the belief that they can make people better.  And I do not hold to that.  So no more running.  I aim to misbehave.There are many, many more that I have omitted.  This story could be used as a study on human nature and a makeshift morality achieved through dialectic.  There is nobody here that is essentially good or essentially bad.  Instead evil is represented by the Alliance, which is really no more than a metaphor for how badly a seemingly benevolent ideology can be twisted.  A core belief held by the Alliance is that, as Mal stated, they can make people better, the opposing viewpoint being that humanity should be free from such intervention, no matter how bad it might get.  We have been seeing a similar struggle play out globally since the Cold War in the two forms of state governance that have dominated the world since then, and in our attempts to spread the ideals therein by force when deemed necessary.  Exactly who is right has not been determined, and I don't think ever will be.  Atrocities have been perpetrated by all sides.  Mankind will continue ever to find its moral equilibrium within the many shades between right and wrong, and struggles such as Mal's and the crew of Serenity will be those that punctuate the very essence of it all.  The story of Serenity always was and always will be the story of mankind, in its largeness and its smallness.","R2ESVRPD0BJF6X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"23 people found this helpful","Joss Whedon: modern Plato?","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ESVRPD0BJF6X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F6BL4FFC","Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2008",,,"amzn1.account.AH3WTE7S2VYSKVM7NMY7CDJCCJTQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH3WTE7S2VYSKVM7NMY7CDJCCJTQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F6BL4FFC",,,,,,

Does it have to do with Seinfeld? Not at all. But now that I've caught your attention, let me tell you about this amazing movie, and the amazing TV show that it's connected with.Serenity is a full-length movie, and it continues on from the TV show, Firefly, which was unfortunately cancelled. Serenity is the name of the ship in Firefly, and it's also obviously the name of this movie. Serenity works as a stand-alone, but it works even better in relation to the TV show. I'd recommend watching Firefly first because Serenity takes place afterwards, but if you don't mind spoilers, I guess watch in whatever order you like. :PThis movie is awesome, as is the show. The characters are back, and they mean business. I loved getting to see a bit more of the crew of Serenity...especially since I definitely didn't get enough from the TV show. I don't think I'll ever get enough. I'll be re-watching this movie more than a few times. You can bet on that. I loved that through Serenity I got to hold on to Mal, Kaylee, Simon, Zoe, Wash, Summer, and Jayne a little while longer. You see Summer get into some crazy situations, and of course some of Mal's dealings that never seem to go the way that he planned...and you get to see some crazy altercations with the Alliance.Now, you're probably wondering what this whole series is all about. Well, Firefly and Serenity take place in the future, Earth is now Earth-that-was and humans have expanded throughout a whole new universe. Mal's crew on Serenity are pretty much thieves, and they're not big fans of the Alliance (the governing body who unified the planets...but also pretty much control everyone). They smuggle, steal, and do pretty much everything to go against the Alliance. If you're new to Firefly and Serenity, as I've said, I recommend Firefly first, but I definitely recommend that you also get yourself a copy of Serenity to watch after you've finished the series because you'll definitely be wanting it! :D","R33Z937QPFMEBJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Serenity Now!

It's particularly beneficial for back and leg exercises, offering the necessary pressure for deep tissue relief.Men's FitnessDurability: Despite regular use, the roller maintains its shape and shows no signs of wear.

It's long enough for comprehensive support yet compact enough for easy storage.Smooth Surface: The roller's smooth texture allows for consistent pressure distribution, making it suitable for users who prefer a uniform surface without ridges or knobs.Cons:Firmness Level: While the firmness is advantageous for deep muscle work, beginners or those with sensitive areas might find it too intense initially. It's advisable to start slowly and adjust as needed.HealthLack of Texture: The absence of ridges means it may not reach certain trigger points as effectively as textured rollers.

My cost when I started 3+ yrs ago was about $24/12, now it is $32/12. I have noticed varying prices, but I did discover the paper cartons are cheaper. I  opted for one that said $23+/-... it ended being $25, but it's still a savings.]* * *I am an elderly woman who is suffering from kidney and heart issues. I don't have much appetite, so also losing muscle like crazy. I am looking like all those other wrinkly, skinny old people I said I wouldn't. So my doctor said high protein shakes. Okay.I started researching. Because of price and ratings I started with a couple 4-pks of Premier from a local grocery outlet. Cafe latte... Yum! Then I went to Amazon to get regular deliveries because I no longer drive. Read lots of reviews.  I noticed some mentions of outlets besides Amazon. I also noticed a link to 'Premier Store'. Given the bad reviews re slime and expiration dates, I carefully made sure I wasn't ordering through an outside source. Don't  know if that actually helped, but I have had very few of those issues in the past 3+ years. **Although, to make sure on the slime, I open a bottle before shaking and check inside the neck and cap, to wipe out if needed. Then re-cap and shake, shake, shake. One could also pour through a fine/tea strainer.**Besides Cafe Latte, I have tasted Peaches and Cream, Vanilla, and Strawberries and Cream. None of these are strong flavored, but I can taste the chocolate and coffee in my favorite. The Vanilla is refreshing, as is the Peaches and Cream (which has a delicate peach flavor). The Strawberries and Cream is cooling and not untasty, just not much flavor. And I have added Bananas and Cream, which is also nice but mild.One more issue: digestion.  Some people's innards don't like the soy and/or the lactose. Others are more forgiving. I get some bloat but the benefit I receive outweighs any mild discomfort. Just because some people can't tolerate this product doesn't mean it's bad.My last note...lead. Lead is bad. But I have been around lead for many decades, from leaded gasoline polluting roadside blackberries (oh, no!) to lead in paint for all kinds of things. It hasn't had much impact on me (that I know of) and I am not giving these to anyone else, so, in the meantime, whatever life I have left will not be spent worrying about it.  Granted, you younger people and children do need to be cautious.Ain't it fun?UPDATE:  23 Oct 20231.  To start, the shakes I get are shipped in thick, heavy-duty boxes in which the bottles are closely and firmly packed and the company name and other pertinent info is printed on the outside. If yours isn't it is likely from an outside vendor, with issues such as expiry dates and improper storage, not to mention higher prices.2.  Regarding the slime and stomach issues, they appear to be caused by the same ""problem""--- the protein. While some flavors have two types of condensed (is that the word I want?) milk proteins combined, many also have soy. The proteins sometimes separate a bit causing the slime.  My suggestion above still holds.And, I'm sorry to say, the stomach issues are also caused by the milk proteins and lactose. Over 60% of Americans suffer from some level of lactose intolerance (not allergy); an individual's level of intolerance will determine how bad you feel. Oh swell!Finally, recycling the bottles: Rinse and zip off the cover which is discarded. Done. BUT if you live in either Oregon (me) or Maine you have the option to redeem the bottles for 10 cents or 5 cents, respectively, if the portion of the cover stating so is still attached. Granted it's not a lot, but it builds....the choice is yours.( I am drinking 2-3 daily, so I am donating my $$ to our residential park's FEMA -sponsered CERT program to buy disaster supplies. [Oregon is in the middle of the Cascadia Subduction Zone --northern CA to Vancouver Island BC-- inevitable massive (9+/-) off shore earthquake. When, not if.]),Now I'm done!

There are lots of brands but a lot of those are chocolate- or vanilla-flavored. I don't like chocolate and vanilla just sounded, well, plain vanilla. Eventually,  found Premiere Protein which offered more than chocolate and vanilla flavors.I chose the peach and cream but I wasn't expecting much.  Peach is one of those flavors that can go horribly wrong.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The peach flavor is good and while I do wish the peach flavor was stronger, it doesn't taste artificial.  Even at 39g of protein, there is none of that chalky, grainy texture that is ick.  The sweetness level is just right for me (although my brother thought it could be sweeter) and the aftertaste from the sweeteners isn't bad.  The consistency of the drink is pleasant, none of the sludge-like consistency that I remember from some other protein drinks.Another thing I liked about this protein drink was that it doesn't have to be cold to taste good.  I have tried other brands that, in my opinion, had to be cold to be drinkable.I think I read somewhere that the peaches and cream, along with a few others, is limited edition.  I like this protein drink and peach flavor so much, I just might stock up before the flavor is no longer available.

It's a good unisex fragrance in my opinion, though I know some may find it too masculine. If you prefer very feminine scents, I would suggest avoiding the teak.I just put it in my car, so I will try to remember to update this on the longevity of the scent once it finally fades. I'll be able to decide whether it's worth it or not by how long it lasts. Initially, at least, this gets 5 stars.Small update - About 3 days after putting this in my car, the intensity of the scent dropped.

I’m not sure if that was the underlying scent of the wood block or the cabana scent itself, but it was not at all what I was expecting, and I didn’t care for it at all. Secondly, the visor clip didn’t even slightly fit on the visor of my 2025 rav4. I had to open it all the way and even then it wasn’t wide enough and ended up sticking off on the front edge, which just loooed silly and defeated the purpose of buying such an expensive, sleek-looking air freshener. They need to release more options for holders for people whose visors don’t work with the one and only option they currently offer. Or offer a wider clip option. The only positive about this is that it does look quite sleek, which is a major pro compared to other car air fresheners. So with better scent options (can we get something lavender based? Or something else floral? Less woods and more herbal), and another option for mounting, I would be willing to purchase from this brand again. However, until then, I can’t recommend, based on an overwhelmingly woody scent and useless clip, especially with such a high price tag.","R2RANECE903XSF",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"12 people found this helpful","All around thoroughly underwhelming","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RANECE903XSF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C1HJV7BJ","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AF46QUSXSOMYOKKNKBDNC56JS4SQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF46QUSXSOMYOKKNKBDNC56JS4SQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Scent: Cabana/Starter Kit","B0C1HJV7BJ","Scent","Cabana/Starter Kit",,,,

One for the driver and passenger side.I installed them on Saturday, the scent was very strong, I see other reviews of people saying just how powerful the scent is and it is true, it's a powerful scent, however, it is right in front of your face as you drive and with the AC on or Heat on will further blow it into your face.Now, as I said, I installed it on Saturday and by Monday the smell was so faint that I forgot that I had installed them.Comes Tuesday, zero scent, I was so disappointed. I questioned myself to see if I had done something wrong, and I followed the instructions that I came with them and I also watched videos on them.Now, I am not sure if it starts off strong and then just supposed to lightly scent your vehicle, because I don't even smell it when I open the door and get in after the door has been closed all night.Maybe I received bad ones? But what are the chances of receiving two bad ones?Even before writing this review I went to my car to see if I was able to smell anything and it was so little that it didn't make sense at all.I think they have a great product here, it looks beautiful within the car, but they need to do more quality checks on this product.Now, they get you by saying that it can last up to 30 days ...

For 4.0+ play consider the Dura Fast 40 when preparing for certain tournaments, but expect only about 2 games per ball, which is quite annoying in my opinion... for 95% of players, definitely go with the Franklin X-40 (except when preparing for a Dura only tournament of course).  If you just want the ball to last and last year after year and don't care at all about egging or quality of play consider the much softer and much slower and much bouncier Onix ball.  The Onix ball is so soft that I can't recommend it for typical play, but it is actually an excellent choice when introducing new players to the game and it is often the preferred ball in 65+ play if mobility becomes a common issue because extra bounce = extra time to get there, but in my area many older players seem to play the X-40 just fine.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Update: 4-13-2021:Popularity: Almost everyone in my area is playing the Franklin X-40 in every park.  I finally saw a Dura in play yesterday, but it's been a long time!  Outdoor tournaments in my state are now about 60% X-40 and about 40% Dura (Washington), so even in tournament play the Dura seems to be going out pretty quick.Seasonal durability of X-40: for the first year I don't think my group cracked a single X-40 (despite having a faster paced game), but using that same batch of balls this Spring, they've all been dropping like flies so now my 1 year old batch of X-40's probably isn't much more durable than brand new Dura's (very annoying to deal with those cracks).  I just bought new X-40's yesterday and I'll be discarding the few X-40's that are left from last year when the new stock arrives.  It will be new X-40's for me once a year from now on assuming quality doesn't slide... fresh manufacturing is apparently very important, so hopefully Franklin will keep their runs moderate, and maybe that's what Dura did wrong.(?)* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Full review:This review will focus largely on the physical & quality comparisons between the Franklin Outdoor X-40 pickleball and the Dura Fast 40 pickleball, but I'll also give a summary of my impressions from the mouth of experts and supplement also by my own amateur impressions and measurements.Dura hole specs: 16 drilled holes @ 0.325"" & 24 drilled holes @ .264""Franklin hole specs: 40 drilled holes @ 0.288""Both balls have 40 holes with an average hole size of 0.288"", but the Dura ball has a far more randomized hole pattern.  I personally didn't notice any difference in spin characteristics or any notable advantage to the randomized hole pattern of the Dura.Franklin weight: 26gDura weight: 25gBoth balls are rotationally molded in one continuous piece so the seam is just as strong as the rest of the ball on either ball... the appearance of a seam is on the outside of the ball only but the visual molding mark is not actually separated in any way in the middle of the ball and the inside of the ball will likewise appear 100% seamless on either ball, so no true seam exists (both balls are true ""1-piece"" balls).  The Dura ball has much smoother molding marks w/ no plastic flashing like the Franklin... this is primarily cosmetic but quality in this regard definitely goes to the Dura.Subjective color preference: in the shade I think the Dura ""Neon"" color looks better (see pic), but in typical full sun the green tint looks dingy on the Dura ball in my opinion, and I feel the Franklin ""Optic Yellow"" is a crisper color that's probably a little more visible.  These are the only 2 ball colors I have to compare.  I would prefer more dye to be used for a green ball so it still looks green in full sun because in my experience with disc golf and ball golf neon green is the most visible color and neon pink is good too... with these 2 options I'd pick the yellow... the green tint on the Dura is so subtle in full sun it ends up looking more like a dingy yellow rather than a green.  A more apples to apples comparison would be Dura's yellow option but I'm pretty confident Franklin would win that contest also based on the notably higher translucency in the plastic used by Dura.  Color: Franklin wins.Franklin X-40 country of origin: ChinaDura Fast 40 country of origin: Vietnam- - EXPERT INSPIRED IMPRESSIONS - -From what I've gathered, expect much longer play per dollar out of the Franklin and expect very little life out of the Dura.  Dura's are supposed to be a little harder/better/faster, but they often only last a few games based on everything I've read and heard.  For older players consider the Onix over either of these balls... softer balls bounce higher and hit slower which allows more time to get to the ball for longer rallies... the Onix seems to be the favorite for play in older aged groups.Based on expert advise from the ""pickleball kitchen"" youtube channel...Best performance award (fastest, hardest): Dura Fast 40Best Value (also w/ great performance): Franklin Outdoor X-40 - - - except high level players should opt for the Dura due to tournament requirements (note: this observation may be outdated... check tournaments in your state to verify what local tournaments are still using the Dura in your area and which tournaments have switched to the X-40)Longest lasting, but soft and bouncy: OnixNote: I have not seen a single outdoor tournament publish the Onix as their ball.My personal recommendation for most players based on a lot of reviews and some research and a close look would be to skip the Dura and go straight to the Franklin X-40 until you're playing tournaments... if/when you advance to the level of playing serious tournament play I don't think it would take long to transition muscle memory and power from the Franklin outdoor ball to the Dura ball and a lot of money and annoyance can be saved w/ the Franklin over the very brittle Dura... Franklin X-40 balls don't last very long either (according to some... possibly old stock), but compared to the Dura it's a notable improvement strongly worth considering even if you're a quality buff like myself.Manufacturing quality: Dura winsMaterial durability: Franklin easily wins and Onix lasts much longer still if you don't mind a notably slower game (more similar to indoor) and more egging.Quality of play: Mixed... many elite players prefer the extra speed of the Dura, but I prefer the consistency of virtually everyone using the same ball and even more notably, I'd rather sacrifice just a little speed to get the higher consistency / predictability / reliability of an uncracked ball and I find it distracting to look for cracks all the time.Value (w/o sacrificing much): FranklinDespite the long read, I'm hoping this helps the reader save some time in selecting a pickleball, especially for players new to the game.","R3URS0SOFTXYOT","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TpQMiFutL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m-EGR+DEL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"766 people found this helpful","Franklin X-40 vs. Dura Fast 40 (vs. Onix)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3URS0SOFTXYOT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B06XTW1BND","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020",,,"amzn1.account.AHENQ4YDNSOJOOSDMNN6RTQJCXRA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHENQ4YDNSOJOOSDMNN6RTQJCXRA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 12 Count, Color: Yellow","B06XTW1BND","Size","12 Count","Color","Yellow",,

You're less likely to crack any of these balls, since you're cycling through so many. Overall better playability and longevity.

Will pay off for your pickleball hype in the long run ;)Tips:. Keep the cardboard box that these balls come in, so you don't have to find a big bucket to fill all these balls with..

When they first arrived, I was skeptical because they were smaller than I thought. Currently , I use them to boost the longevity of a larger ice pack with the additional benefit of being able to form small compartments within the cooler bag due to their slim profiles. Even after 12 hours and cooling about 16oz of body temperature breastmilk, these coolers are cold to the touch in the morning. Color me impressed!I previously had two cooler bags that eventually leaked with repeated use. Once, I dropped one of these coolers onto my hardwood and it landed on its corner. I held my breath as I examined for leaks, but it was good to go! Add durability to its list of pros.Even though I bought these for storing breastmilk, I can see these being useful in the future for packing kids lunches or keeping groceries cool.

I recently discovered the Monster Energy makes bulk packs of 15 cans! It has quickly become my go-to choice for combating fatigue and enhancing mental alertness. This detailed review will cover my experience with this product, including its taste, effectiveness, affordability, and overall impact on my daily routine.Packaging and Presentation:The Monster Energy Zero Ultra arrives in a sturdy and well-packaged bulk box containing 15 cans, each neatly stacked to prevent any damage during shipping. The sleek and modern design of the cans immediately catches the eye, with the iconic Monster logo and vibrant colors reflecting the brand's energy-driven identity. The packaging ensures convenience and portability, making it easy to store and grab a can whenever needed, whether at home, work, or on the go.Taste and Flavor Profile:One of the standout features of Monster Energy Zero Ultra is its refreshing taste and appealing flavor profile. As a sugar-free energy drink enthusiast, I appreciate the balanced blend of citrus flavors with a hint of sweetness, which is both invigorating and enjoyable to drink. Unlike other energy drinks that can be overly sweet or artificial in taste, Monster Energy Zero Ultra offers a clean and crisp flavor that doesn't leave a lingering aftertaste. It's refreshing and satisfying, providing an instant pick-me-up without the guilt of added sugars.Effectiveness and Performance:In terms of effectiveness, Monster Energy Zero Ultra delivers on its promise to boost energy levels and enhance mental focus. The combination of caffeine, taurine, and B-vitamins provides a noticeable and sustained energy lift, which is particularly beneficial during hectic days or when tackling mentally demanding tasks. I find that it helps sharpen my concentration and mental clarity, allowing me to stay productive and alert without the jitters or crash often associated with sugary energy drinks. Whether powering through deadlines at work or staying energized during workouts, Monster Energy Zero Ultra consistently delivers reliable performance and stamina support.Affordability and Value for Money:Purchasing Monster Energy Zero Ultra in a bulk pack of 15 cans offers significant cost savings compared to buying individual cans or smaller packs. The value for money is exceptional, especially considering the quality and effectiveness of the product. By opting for the bulk option, I not only save money but also ensure that I always have a supply of energy drinks on hand to meet my daily energy needs without frequent trips to the store. This affordability makes Monster Energy Zero Ultra a practical choice for budget-conscious consumers looking to maximize their energy expenditure.Convenience and Versatility:The convenience of having a supply of Monster Energy Zero Ultra readily available cannot be overstated. Whether I need a quick energy boost before a workout, a long drive, or a late-night study session, the easy accessibility of these cans ensures that I can maintain peak performance levels throughout the day. The compact size and lightweight nature of the cans make them portable and convenient for carrying in a backpack, gym bag, or car compartment, ensuring I never have to compromise on my energy levels wherever I go.Overall Impact on Daily Routine:In summary, Monster Energy Zero Ultra has significantly enhanced my daily routine by providing a reliable and effective energy solution. From its appealing taste and refreshing flavor to its ability to boost mental alertness and stamina, this sugar-free energy drink has become an indispensable part of my lifestyle. The decision to purchase in bulk has proven to be a wise investment, offering both financial savings and peace of mind knowing that I have a dependable energy source at my disposal whenever needed.

I am grieving for my younger brother who died in August, and crying is just a part of who I am now. One day at work, not long after I purchased my Lash Princess, I was thinking of him and couldn’t stop crying. I was in my own office with the door shut, but I was out of tissues (go figure). So I made a quick dash for the bathroom hoping no one would see me, because I was sure that there was mascara all over my face… but there wasn’t. Like, at all. I checked later to see if I had ordered waterproof by mistake, and I hadn’t. It’s just. That. Good.You can’t beat the price, the effects are stunning, and the product really holds up to anything you can throw at it.I will say that when I apply it, I first blot the wand off with a tissue. Especially when you have a new tube, a lot of product comes off at once and it can get clumpy if you apply too much. Otherwise no complaints.

I came across Essence and I read the reviews which were all pretty good so I decided to try. I have been using it and I can honestly say that it makes a huge difference. It truly makes my lashes look longer and fuller. I do like it but I don’t love it. Reason for that is that it smudges. I almost always have a little bit under my eyes sometime in the day while wearing it. Other than that, it would be perfect. I guess I just need to play around with some hacks to avoid smudging.

I searched online for the best options. Originally I was going to go with one that said that it would last for 2 years, but the price was higher and I wasn't as confident that it could actually make the two-year mark. So I decided to go with something a little bit more tried and true. When this showed up was just after I arrived home from an overtime shift. I could have waited but decided to head right out and replace the blades for my Drive-In first thing in the morning. There is a QR code that can be scanned and a physical instruction manual, both of which I ignored because how complicated could it be to install windshield wiper blades. This product can be used on the different types of arms for the vehicle and you break the plastic in a certain way to fit your type of vehicle. Needless to say I did need the instruction sheet as this was my first time using this specific type of product versus the dirt cheap wiper blades that I normally purchase. Additionally I find myself slightly embarrassed as I thought the yellow strip were the wiper section of the product. It is in fact a harder plastic guard that needs to be removed before you use the product. It actually says in small black lettering on the yellow protective piece that you should remove it before use. Stupid does not exactly begin to describe how I felt Once I arrived at work with those plastic guards still on. I did remove them at that point and am satisfied with the product. I don't know about the supposed Rain-X chemical that is supposed to be on the blades, but then I am putting them on at the beginning of Summer so we'll see.","R3N881SID5O1EW",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","Recommended but you may want to look at the instructions","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N881SID5O1EW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084CT24NM","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFDFEUN37BMTU7FXBUB3QN6KACVQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDFEUN37BMTU7FXBUB3QN6KACVQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 18"" and 18"", Color: Latitude Water Repellency","B084CT24NM","Size","18"" and 18""","Color","Latitude Water Repellency",,

Here’s my take on these wipers after several weeks of use.Design and Build QualityThe Rain-X Latitude wiper blades feature a sleek, aerodynamic design that not only looks good but also minimizes wind lift at high speeds. The construction feels robust, and the rubber blade is durable and flexible, allowing it to conform well to the curvature of my windshield. The quality of materials used is evident; I expect these blades to last much longer than standard wiper blades.PerformanceThe standout feature of these wiper blades is the patented Rain-X water repellency formula. It truly makes a difference! As soon as I activated my wipers during a rain shower, I noticed how effectively they cleared the water, leaving behind a streak-free finish. The water beads up and rolls off the windshield, improving visibility dramatically even at higher speeds. This unique feature means I don’t have to rely solely on the wipers in heavy rain, enhancing safety while driving.InstallationInstallation was a breeze. The wiper blades came with clear instructions, and I was able to replace my old wipers in under 5 minutes without any special tools. The universal fit meant they easily attached to my vehicle without any hassle.Noise LevelOne of my concerns with new wiper blades is noise during operation. I’m happy to report that the Rain-X Latitude blades operate quietly, even at higher speeds. There’s no annoying squeaking or chattering, which is a significant plus for me.LongevityWhile I’ve only been using these wiper blades for a short time, they seem to hold up well against wear and tear. The rubber material resists cracking and splitting, and I’m hopeful that the water-repellent feature will last through several rain stormsOverall, I highly recommend the Rain-X 810165 Latitude 2-In-1 Water Repellent Wiper Blades. Their combination of sleek design, exceptional performance, and user-friendly installation makes them a top choice for anyone looking to enhance their driving experience in wet conditions. If you’re in the market for reliable windshield wipers that truly deliver on their promises, these are definitely worth considering!","REJFNT2I7ASM7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6 people found this helpful","Great wipers with added bonus","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REJFNT2I7ASM7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084CT24NM","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFTZUIDMVFYLA52SDQALLB3JT2TA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFTZUIDMVFYLA52SDQALLB3JT2TA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 22"" and 22"", Color: Latitude Water Repellency","B084CT24NM","Size","22"" and 22""","Color","Latitude Water Repellency",,

According to customer feedback and product descriptions available online, these blades perform notably well:Water Repellency: The blades transfer Rain-X's patented water-repellent technology directly onto the windshield, which helps water bead and roll off, significantly improving visibility in rain, sleet, or snow. Users have noted that this feature activates effectively, providing a clear view with minimal streaking once the activation process is followed correctly.Installation: They come with a universal adapter, which seems to fit most vehicle types easily. However, some users have reported that installation can be a bit tricky if not done according to the instructions, especially removing the protective plastic cover over the squeegee.Durability: Users generally praise the blades for their longevity, with many reporting effective use for up to 9-10 months, although there are mentions of occasional streaking after extended use. The blades are made with a synthetic rubber squeegee that resists weather conditions well, but like all products, they do wear over time.Noise and Vibration: These blades are often described as quiet and smooth, with less squeaking or chattering compared to cheaper alternatives, which enhances the driving experience, especially on highways.Pros:Effective water repellency enhances visibility in wet conditions.Quiet operation with minimal noise.Durable, with many users reporting good performance over several months.Easy installation with the provided adapter system.Cons:Initial setup might require a bit more attention to remove the protective cover properly.Some users report occasional streaking or hard lines on the windshield over time.ConclusionThe Rain-X 5079281-2 Latitude 2-In-1 Wiper Blades stand out for their dual functionality in both clearing and repelling water, offering a significant advantage in poor weather conditions. They are praised for their performance, ease of installation, and durability, although they require careful initial setup to ensure optimal performance. If you're looking for wiper blades that go beyond just wiping but also treat your windshield for better visibility, these could be a worthy investment. Just be mindful of the need to activate the water repellency feature properly for the best results.Recommendation: Recommended for those who value enhanced visibility and are willing to spend a bit more for quality and performance. However, always check if these blades are compatible with your specific vehicle model for the best fit.","RMEK54TTNX81L",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6 people found this helpful","Rain-X 5079281-2 Latitude 2-In-1 Wiper Blades","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMEK54TTNX81L/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084CT24NM","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGNFIEYRE3B7CWAG7NSUC7FJVBEQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNFIEYRE3B7CWAG7NSUC7FJVBEQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 26"", Color: _","B084CT24NM","Size","26""","Color","_",,

The two officers survey the house and descend into the basement, noting the fingernail scratch marks, human blood and hair embedded into the walls.We are then brought to August 1973 where five young adults, Erin (Jessica Biel), Kemper (Eric Balfour), Morgan (Jonathan Tucker), Andy (Mike Vogel), and Pepper (Erica Leerhsen), are on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert after returning from Mexico. As they drive through Texas, they see a distraught hitchhiker (Lauren German), who eventually gets in their van. After trying to speak to the hitchhiker, who speaks incoherently about ""a bad man"", she shoots and kills herself with a .357 Magnum. The group tries to contact the police, then go to a store where a woman (Marietta Marich) tells them the sheriff is at the mill. Instead of the sheriff, they find a little boy named Jedediah (David Dorfman) who tells them that the sheriff is at home drinking. Erin and Kemper go through the woods to find his house, leaving the other three at the mill with the boy. They come to a plantation house where Erin is allowed inside by the owner, an amputee named Monty, to phone for help. When Erin finishes, the old man asks her for help. Kemper goes inside to look for Erin and attacked by the vicious-looking Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski), who hits him with a sledgehammer. When Leatherface takes Kemper's body to begin to make a new mask out of him, he discovers a small black box from Kemper; opening it, he discovers a ring meant for Erin.Meanwhile, Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey) arrives at the mill and disposes of the hitchhiker's body, wrapping her in cellophane and putting her in his trunk in which he drives away and tells the youths to leave. Erin arrives and finds that Kemper is still missing. Andy and Erin go back to the Monty's house, where Erin distracts him while Andy searches for Kemper. Monty realizes Andy is inside and summons Leatherface, who attacks him with his chainsaw. Erin escapes and heads towards the woods, but Leatherface cuts Andy's leg off. Leatherface carries him to the basement and hangs him on a meat hook with his feet hanging over a piano, where he rubs salt on Andy's stump of a leg before wrapping it in butcher paper and tying it with human hair.Erin makes it to the mill and tries to escape in the van, but the sheriff shows up and, after finding marijuana, orders Erin, Morgan and Pepper to get out of the van. The sheriff gives Morgan the gun he took from the hitchhiker and tells Morgan to reenact how she killed herself. Morgan, scared and disturbed by the sheriff's demeanor, and under pressure by Erin and Pepper, attempts to shoot the sheriff only to find the gun is unloaded. Sheriff Hoyt handcuffs Morgan and drives him to the Hewitt house (a drive which includes a brutal beating), leaving the girls in the van. Erin tries to fix the truck, while Pepper holds a flashlight. Erin gets the truck running, but the one of the wheels rolls out. Erin and Pepper stay still in the truck but Leatherface appears on the top of the truck and tries to attack them. After witnessing Pepper's murder by Leatherface, Erin, who sees that Leatherface is wearing Kemper's face over his own, runs to escape and hides in a nearby trailer with two women inside, who offer her tea and try to soothe her. The two women, an obese middle-aged woman known only as the 'Tea Lady' and a younger woman named Henrietta, whom is presumably her daughter, act strange and after they tell Erin they don't have a phone for her to call for help, a telephone in the trailer rings and Henrietta picks it up and tells someone on the other end that ""she's here"". Erin discovers they have kidnapped a child when she sees that the baby with them is the same child in a photograph with the woman who committed suicide earlier. However, the tea is drugged and she passes out when she tries to leave.Erin wakes up at the Hewitt house surrounded by the Hewitt family: Leatherface, his mother Luda May, Sheriff Hoyt, Uncle Monty, and the little boy Jedediah. Luda May tells Erin that her excuse for her son Thomas' actions, was that her son was tormented by teenagers and that she felt no one cared for her family besides themselves. Erin is taken to the basement, where she finds Andy. She tries to help him off of the meat hook but when he sees he will land on the piano keys and alert Leatherface, he begs her to kill him, which she does, though suffers severe emotional trauma. She finds Morgan, still handcuffed, and Jedediah leads them out of the house. Jedediah rejects Erin's plea to come with them and distracts Leatherface long enough for them to escape. Erin and Morgan find an abandoned house in the woods and barricade themselves inside. Leatherface breaks in and discovers Erin, but Morgan attacks Leatherface, causing him to drop his chainsaw. Morgan grabs him and wrestles him, but Leatherface is too heavy and easily lifts Morgan upwards onto a chandelier before releasing him and Morgan gets tangled in the chandelier by his handcuffs. Leatherface picks up his chainsaw and slices up into Morgan's crotch, killing him.Erin runs out of the shack and escapes through the woods. Leatherface trips and cuts his leg while pursuing her. Erin finds a slaughterhouse and hides in a locker; Leatherface opens the locker across from hers and she attacks him with a meat cleaver, and chops off his right arm. Erin runs outside and flags down a trucker, whom she tries to convince to go away from the Hewitt's house, but he stops to find help at the eatery. Erin sees Luda May and watches as Sheriff Hoyt arrives and talks to the trucker. Erin sees Henrietta watching over the kidnapped baby in a highchair. When Henrietta walks outside to join Luda May and Sheriff Hoyt whom are talking to the truck driver, Erin sneaks the baby out of the eatery and hot-wires the sheriff's car before running him over repeatedly until he is dead. Leatherface appears in the road and tries to stop her, but Erin and the baby escape unharmed.The police archive footage continues to play. The officers inspect the basement noting the hanging meat hooks when suddenly one of the officers is grabbed and severely beaten. A blurred figure viciously shakes the camera and the other police officer is heard screaming. The narrator states that ""The crime scene was not properly secured by Travis County Police. Two investigating officers were fatally wounded that day. This is the only known image of Thomas Hewitt, the man they call Leatherface. The case today still remains open"".You NEED THIS MOVIE ! it's gore , gore , gore , gore , gore & more gore !","R2KJ18T8ACWURP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5 people found this helpful","Gore, Chiansaw, Gore !","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KJ18T8ACWURP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0FBHG9YLY","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2012",,,"amzn1.account.AHJITBCPN7YTQTEC2FPGB53OTC3A","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJITBCPN7YTQTEC2FPGB53OTC3A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0FBHG9YLY",,,,,,

It was truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Nothing happened in it. There was ZERO suspense or excitement, the dialogue was barely audible and it felt like another half of it was missing. I hated it and I am so puzzled why so many people love that film.Granted, back in 1973 it may have been easier to scare audiences and the low-budget nature of the original may have contributed to the ugly look of the film but I see no reason to credit the original director (Tobe Hooper) with any of the film's so-called qualities. The man's career fell flat on it's face soon after and I think his most famous movie was something of a fluke. It would not have succeeded today. Obviously, as I just said, audiences today are exposed to a larger number of movies and can choose and discriminate more easily. There are some who will say the only people who can enjoy this will be degenerate teenagers who don't know what real horror is. And some who will call the film to glossy. But none of this I find fair criticism.I am, in no way, a fan of Michael Bay or any of his movies. But he had the right idea in keeping the budget very low for this movie ($8 million) and seems to be more skilled in packaging and producing than directing. The film is not 'glossy' or 'clean'. The equipment use to make the film is more sophisticated than that on the original but this is not 'The Rock' or 'Armageddon' and there are no hundred-shots-in-a-second and flashy camera tricks. They all tried their best to pull of a nervous, raw horror film that stands on it's own and I think they have.This was sooooooo much better than the first. The characters actually HAVE character this time. I got on their side, I got involved in the action (yes, there is action this time, and a LOT of it) and the acting was done well. Plus Jessica Biel is VERY hot.So many new dimensions and situations occur is this remake that elevates to something a zillion times what the original was. Don't automatically think that because Michael Bay is the producer that it's going to be some kind of sanitised and fashion-shoot Hollywood production. It is still a very edgy and intense film. It's rare that a Hollywood film manages to horrify and offend these days, so I'm very glad the new TCM went for a hard R-rating. The tone is so filthy and depraved that you will definitely need to shower soon afterwards. THAT'S how close you get to the action.Even the character of Thomas 'Leatherface' Hewitt has a lot more to do this time. He's not quite Jason Voorhees but he's still an incredibly mean bad guy you'd NEVER want to mess with or come within 10 miles of. And in case you're wondering, he's played by the same dude who played Butterfinger, the big, dumb blonde guy from Hudson Hawk. Only this time he's not so cuddly.Not since 8mm almost 5 years ago have I seen a film where the bad guys (there's more than one) are nothing but the blackest of all evil. R. Lee Ermey was terrific (as usual) as the disgusting Sheriff and any fans of him should only expect the most badass of performances.Second to Dawn of the Dead (and tying with House of 1000 Corpses) this is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time.The Platinum Series DVD is just awesome. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is superb and the Dolby 6.1/DTS ES soundtracks are incredible. You'll really think Leatherface is chainsawing his way into YOUR living room. There are also a massive load of interesting extras including a 75-minute documentary, deleted scenes, a documentary on serial killer Ed Gein (who was 'supposedly the inspiration for the original but Tobe Hooper denied these rumors) and screen test footage. The packaging is awesome with a metal plate stuck on the front cover and 'crime scene' photos in a little envelope tucked into back. It completes a great package of a great DVD of a great movie. Buy it!!!","R13TPZSI95ZMR1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"9 people found this helpful","Very bold and intense horror and a great DVD","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13TPZSI95ZMR1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0FBHG9YLY","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2004",,,"amzn1.account.AGJY444VSFTXWHXZUPXITWAE724Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJY444VSFTXWHXZUPXITWAE724Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0FBHG9YLY",,,,,,

It is designed to be easy to install and remove, and its foldable design allows for compact storage when not in use, typically in the car’s glove compartment or door pocket.Reflective Surface:The sunshade features a reflective silver surface that bounces the sun’s rays away from the car, helping to reduce the amount of heat that enters the vehicle. This reflective design enhances its effectiveness, providing a noticeable difference in interior temperature when compared to not using a sunshade.Protects Interior from Heat:The heat protection offered by this windshield sunshade helps prevent the car’s interior from becoming unbearably hot. This is especially beneficial for those who live in areas with extreme summer temperatures, as it reduces the need for air conditioning when entering the vehicle.Affordable Price Point:The EcoNour Car Shade is offered at a reasonable price point, making it an affordable option for those looking to protect their car's interior without spending a lot of money.

Some users may need to purchase additional shades for other parts of the vehicle.Manual adjustment required: Unlike some more advanced sunshades with automatic mechanisms, this model requires manual adjustment each time it is installed or removed, which could be a small inconvenience for some.Conclusion:The EcoNour Car Shade Front Windshield is an excellent product for anyone looking to protect their vehicle’s interior from the damaging effects of the sun. Its high-quality reflective material, UV and heat protection, and large size make it a great fit for larger vehicles like SUVs and trucks.

After the 3rd use I can notice the change. The best way to use this, lather and put on your skin, face, neck, hands, ect... let it stay on for 2-5 minutes than gently remove with water leaving a light residue of the product on the skin. Now in my opinion this is the important part. With a light layer of the product left of the face, using your fingers rub up/down & circular motion on your skin like your rolling off dead skin. This is the top layer of the dead cells that causes wrinkles, sunspots, dark spots, dryness. Again, when I initially rinse the product, I leave a light layer of product on my skin to make it easier to rub & exfoliate the top dead cells on my face, neck, hands( I also used it on my elbows, knees & armpits, 4 bars for $20 is a great deal & I'm willing to buy more since I had awesome results). What I learned about skincare as I get older especially on my face. It's constantly being exposed to environmental elements, sun damage, make-up, my pillow, hard water. By exfoliating my face once a week with a good moisturizer( I used Lancome Absolue Rich or Soft Cream $280 or coconut oil. Dont use a moisturizer with alcohol or Parfums cause it will irritate your skin). It's important to moisturize afterwards cause this product just removed dead cell skin & moisturizer is key! At 45 my skin looks amazing but I had these light sunspots and dry dead skin that causes aging. Not super noticeable but noticeable to me on my cheek bone area and around my eyes. I not only focus on my face but my entire body especially the neck and hands cause those are the areas women tend to neglect and are aging giveaways with sunspots, wrinkles. Also I'd recommend doing this at night before bed to allow your skin to heal vs. going out in the elements wind, sun, humidity and exposing your newly clean sensitive skin to damage causing activities. Again my opinion simply because this bar soap removed the top layer of skin leaving the underlaying of skin, the soft, sumple, fresh layer of skin that gives you the glow & youthfulness we all want.Also I know this is weird but don't do it around your menstrual period time.  Why? As a women our hormones are crazy and I know I break out around my chin area. You definitely don't want to irritate your skin while your hormones aka acne period are the cause for a short time of the month. This can cause bacteria around your pimples, break & scratch the skin, leaving scars or marks. Again my own opinion but it works for me cause my hormones cause me to have acne plus I have Lupus and I get butterfly like rash on my face over my nose bridge & cheeksHope my review helps but definitely a good buy!","R2DX6N9QQYJQFQ","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PsQ8qUddL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61md93HTZzL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1,621 people found this helpful","Definitely works!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DX6N9QQYJQFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09MFMCTRK","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AFRQWSNQPMS2R3TXH62GMITXWTCQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFRQWSNQPMS2R3TXH62GMITXWTCQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Style: 4 Pack","B09MFMCTRK","Style","4 Pack",,,,

Whether you're a beginner, a senior, or someone with a moderate swing speed, these balls offer a blend of performance and value that's hard to beat.​Golf SpanPerformance & FeelThe Supersoft features a compression rating of 38, making it one of the softest balls on the market. This low compression is ideal for players with swing speeds under 100 mph, as it allows for better energy transfer during impact . The result is a ball that feels like a marshmallow off the clubface—soft, responsive, and forgiving.​Around the greens, the Hybrid Cover provides a soft touch that many golfers appreciate, offering decent control on chips and putts. While it may not offer the same level of spin as tour-level balls, it strikes a good balance between distance and short-game performance .​Distance & AccuracyThanks to its HyperElastic SoftFast Core and HEX Aerodynamics, the Supersoft delivers impressive ball speed and a high launch, resulting in longer carry and total distance . The low spin helps reduce hooks and slices, promoting straighter shots and increased accuracy .​ConsiderationsWhile the Supersoft excels in many areas, players with higher swing speeds may find that it doesn't provide the same level of performance as higher-compression balls designed for faster swings . Additionally, the soft cover can show wear over time, so it's advisable to inspect the ball for scuffs or cuts after each round.​Final VerdictThe Callaway Supersoft Golf Balls are an excellent choice for golfers seeking a soft feel, increased distance, and improved accuracy without a hefty price tag. Its combination of performance and value makes it a standout option for mid to high handicappers and recreational players alike","R2QRQTDSHYHGJK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5 people found this helpful","A Soft Touch That Delivers","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QRQTDSHYHGJK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BMGYT38K","Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGBFNTYQPFB55M3OXP3SP3COWV6A","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBFNTYQPFB55M3OXP3SP3COWV6A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: White, Size: One Dozen, Style: 2023","B0BMGYT38K","Color","White","Size","One Dozen","Style","2023"

They’re forgiving for newer players but still responsive enough for finesse shots.They also have a super durable cover. I’ve played several rounds with the same ball and it still looks great.

My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer instead to heal my skin barrier and...wow. I haven't had any dryness since. On top of that, I was hitting a wall with my actives; they weren't as effective at fading my acne scars after a while. But once I introduced this moisturizer (and stopped scrubbing my face with a washcloth), I actually noticed them starting to fade. It does have a slight scent, but it's worth it for how effective it is. Highly recommend if you have acne scars or a compromised barrier.","RESRMA21CNMB3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6 people found this helpful","Better than I imagined","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RESRMA21CNMB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N9SPQHQ","Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGMNDIR7VILO4R5YXAA4N62UWMHA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGMNDIR7VILO4R5YXAA4N62UWMHA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Style: 3.38 Fl Oz (Non SPF)","B01N9SPQHQ","Style","3.38 Fl Oz (Non SPF)",,,,

As someone with combination skin that's prone to sensitivity, it’s often hard to find a moisturizer that hydrates effectively without clogging pores, causing breakouts, or leaving a greasy finish—but this one checks all the boxes.The first thing I appreciated was its lightweight, oil-free texture. It glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly, leaving no residue or stickiness behind. My skin immediately feels soothed and hydrated, and I can confidently layer sunscreen or makeup over it without any pilling.What truly sets this moisturizer apart is the ingredient list. The inclusion of ceramides helps restore the skin’s natural barrier, while niacinamide calms irritation and reduces redness—something I’ve personally seen an improvement in after a couple of weeks of consistent use. It’s fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for anyone with reactive skin or who wants to avoid unnecessary additives.I started using this product after dealing with a period of over-exfoliation that left my skin feeling tight, dry, and inflamed. Within a few days of using this moisturizer, I noticed my skin felt more balanced and resilient. The dryness and irritation subsided, and my skin began to feel soft and look healthier.Another great aspect is its suitability for all skin types—whether oily, dry, or acne-prone, this formula provides hydration without overwhelming the skin. It’s simple, effective, and dermatologically trusted, which gives me confidence in using it long-term.If you're looking for a no-fuss, deeply hydrating, and skin-barrier-supporting moisturizer, I can’t recommend this enough. It delivers visible results and works beautifully under other skincare or makeup products.Five stars for performance, comfort, and reliability!","RA3OXT9QMXFT5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"35 people found this helpful","Lightweight, Effective, and Perfect for Sensitive Skin","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA3OXT9QMXFT5/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N9SPQHQ","Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEUDA3FU43TZOSHD4NUFN5RL36HA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEUDA3FU43TZOSHD4NUFN5RL36HA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Style: 3.38 Fl Oz (Non SPF)","B01N9SPQHQ","Style","3.38 Fl Oz (Non SPF)",,,,

Although Sam is taking up the mantle of Captain America, he does have this song doubt that he doesn’t deserve it but Bucky a.k.a. the winter soldier told him that Steve chose him for a reason because he saw that he was a good man and would see the good in the people, and to give the people to believe in something. Also, I like Joaquin as the new Falcon, he was very fun to watch.

No action, boring dialogue and missed opportunities. I disagree on all accounts.The action continues throughout the entirety of its near two hour length, the story reveals itself by way of Cap searching for the real threat and the discovery of a new element has just opened the world up to so much potential.There were a couple of moments that seemed to pander to the audience, but those moments weren’t all that intrusive anyway. There is only one scene during the credits, quite unnecessary in all honesty, and it is by far the weakest part of the whole.

The film picks up following the events of the Disney+ television series “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” as well as continuing on from the “Captain America” and “Avengers” films. In the story, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) now works as Captain America and is aided by Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), the new Falcon. They find themselves drawn into a spy game following the election of Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford, replacing the late William Hurt) to the Presidency and the geopolitical ramifications of the discovery of adamantium in the Celestial Island left over from the events of Chloé Zhao’s 2021 film, “Eternals.” The film sets up a race for resources with Japan and the United States as the largest players in the contest. President Ross and Cap have their own rocky history, made all the worse when a trigger sets off Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) at a White House reception, forcing Cap to help capture his old friend while also figuring out what the President is hiding.The film introduces Sidewinder (Giancarlo Esposito) and Copperhead (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson) as members of Serpent, thereby using an early story idea for the third Cap film before it was changed to “Civil War.” While other Marvel projects have hearkened back to Louis Leterrier’s 2008 film, “The Incredible Hulk,” hoping to demonstrate the importance of the second entry in the MCU through cameos in Destin Daniel Cretton’s 2021 film, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” and Jessica Gao’s 2022 Disney+ series, “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,” Onah uses “Brave New World” to tie together the most threads from “Incredible Hulk” with Thaddeus Ross’ prominent role, the return of Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) who had his brain exposed to gamma in “Incredible Hulk,” and a brief cameo from Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Just as “Civil War” was both a Cap film and an Iron Man film, “Brave New World” is both a Cap film and a Hulk film.At times, the political thriller elements struggle to hold suspense since the film’s marketing gave away several of the biggest twists. Harrison Ford gives one of his best dramatic performance, imbuing the character with more pathos than William Hurt had been able to do in previous films (not due to a lack on Hurt’s part, but because of how those prior films used the character). For his part, Anthony Mackie continues to demonstrate why he was the right person to take up the shield and become Cap. He shows mercy, compassion, and introspection even as he’s delivers fantastically choreographed and athletic fight scenes. Shira Haas rounds out the cast as Ruth Bat-Seraph, who Onah reimagines as a former Black Widow. Changes to the character’s origin and costume help with some of the controversy surrounding her inclusion given current real-world events. Further, the character’s initial debut in the “Hulk” comics adds to the role of the Hulk mythos in this movie. Unfortunately, the film doesn’t make her a mutant and thus misses the opportunity to use both her inclusion and the appearance of adamantium to further lay the groundwork for the X-Men. Overall, “Brave New World” is an enjoyable film with Anthony Mackie shining as Cap, but the film struggles to balance several subplots and could have used the political thriller elements to greater effect as an allegory for our own political situation. Ford’s portrayal of President Ross and the parallels to “The Manchurian Candidate” work particularly well.This Blu-Ray/4K steelbook is a great way for Cap fans to add this film to their collection. It includes featurettes about Anthony Macke’s portrayal of Sam Wilson over the years, a look at Sam’s greatest foes, a gag reel, deleted scenes, and audio commentary. I do wish there was more about the effects both practical and digital as well as an inclusion of art cards like Marvel has done in the past. The art on the packaging is particularly nice and recalls some of the current posters for John Frankenheimer’s 1962 film, “The Manchurian Candidate.”","R1IM1KZ6GGIYVM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fun, but Often Balancing Too Many Plot Threads","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IM1KZ6GGIYVM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F4BRHCXJ","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGEKA6WODQNV3G5QBLHTEBDDZNQA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEKA6WODQNV3G5QBLHTEBDDZNQA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F4BRHCXJ",,,,,,

It’s like a delightfully beachy, bright mixture of peach & coconut milk carried by solar florals. It brings a lot of beautiful sunny tropical warmth without becoming sweet or cloying, which I love!!It’s a perfect soft, warm summer fragrance that brings happy beachy vibes & memories of summers past (at least for someone raised in CA) but isn’t artificial smelling or overwhelming, even on a super hot day where fragrances can get sickening quickly. Its softness can also be its weakness though, as it remains faint no matter how often you reapply it! It has very low projection/ silage & seems to fade from mildly there at onset to barely detectable levels extremely quickly, even for Sol mists which don’t have great lasting power in general. Which is such a shame because for a few beautiful fleeting moments between the alcohol dry down & the nearly immediate fading of the fragrance it smells almost exactly like HARAJUKU LOVERS G PERFUME from the early 2000’s which I LOVED.It has that same good beachy coconut note where it sits between fresh coconut milk & warm suntan lotion coconut smell, but avoids the gourmand toasty/nutty/sweet quality that a lot of other coconut fragrances have & instead stays in the sunny/creamy/fresh but warm tropical lane.You definitely smell the fresh juicy brightness of the peach at initial spray, with no candy or artificial notes, it really smells like a fresh super ripe juicy peach which sadly does not stay & fades into a barely detectable but warm fruity note in the dry down.There is also a super slight pear note that others have mentioned but it sits under the peach note from initial spray to dry down. Also, as someone who finds flowering pear trees to stink, (IYKYK) this pear note did not turn on my skin like some others had mentioned. I was super worried about this element but the pear is barely there & for me thankfully did not go into rancid stink, but seems to be a risk factor for some if you’re sensitive to that.The frangipani petals honestly are where most of the warmth to this fragrance comes from, & they definitely live in that solar warm floral arena, NOT in the sugar warm floral aspect of frangipani that a lot of mists lean into to. However it is still a sweet/sunny/honey smelling flower like alyssum & brings in the warmth through that aspect but at no point does it overwhelm the coconut milk & peach notes, & instead comes in & gently rounds them out without removing them.I can see why many people were surprised by this mist, but also why I love it: it is definitely NON-gourmand, but rather a fruity sunny floral, coconut fragrance. It’s gentle, tropical, & warm while still staying fresh, fruity & uplifting. I only wish it wouldn’t fade so quickly, & would retain the initial brightness of the peach throughout the dry down. The lack of silage might keep me from buying again, but also the well-balanced, barely there yet delightfully beachy fragrance might bring me back, at least until I find a better G dupe.

After using this mat consistently for several weeks, I can confidently say it delivers exceptional value and comfort, especially for those who need a little extra cushioning and support during their workouts or stretching routines.🧘‍♀️ Comfort & Cushioning – Perfect for JointsWhat really sets this mat apart is the extra-thick 1/2-inch padding. The high-density foam offers a plush, supportive surface that’s ideal for exercises that involve kneeling, sitting, or lying down. Whether I’m doing yoga poses, Pilates, stretching, or even light bodyweight training, the mat provides a shock-absorbing cushion that reduces stress on my knees, elbows, wrists, and spine.If you have joint sensitivity or simply prefer more comfort than what a typical yoga mat offers, this thickness is a game-changer. It strikes a great balance between soft and firm—it cushions well without feeling like you’re sinking into it.🧼 Easy to Clean & MaintainThe textured, moisture-resistant surface makes the mat super easy to clean. I usually wipe it down with a damp cloth after each use, and it dries quickly without holding on to odors or stains. The material doesn’t absorb sweat, and the surface texture also adds a bit of grip—enough to keep me grounded during poses and stretches, though it’s best suited for low- to medium-intensity sessions rather than fast-paced or hot yoga where more traction is required.👜 Lightweight & Portable with StrapAnother thoughtful feature is the included carrying strap. It’s a simple but useful addition that makes it easy to roll up the mat and sling it over your shoulder for transport. The mat itself is lightweight, which means I can easily carry it to the gym, a yoga class, or even to the park for an outdoor session. It stores compactly when rolled up and doesn’t take up much space.💪 Versatile for All ActivitiesThis isn’t just a yoga mat—it’s great for a wide range of floor exercises. I’ve used it for stretching, strength training, core work, foam rolling, and meditation. The generous thickness makes it especially good for lying exercises, offering comfort and insulation from hard or cold floors.At approximately 74 inches long, the mat provides ample space even for taller individuals. I never feel like I’m running out of room when stretching out fully or moving through different positions.🧩 Durable and Holds Up WellDespite its softness, the mat is remarkably durable. It doesn’t tear, flake, or wear down easily, even with daily use. The foam retains its shape well and doesn't compress too much over time. It lies flat on the floor without curling at the edges, and the finish hasn’t shown any signs of peeling or cracking.✅ Final ThoughtsThe Amazon Basics Extra Thick Exercise Yoga Mat is a standout in its price range. It offers the comfort and functionality of more expensive mats without the high cost. Whether you’re a beginner looking for a soft introduction to yoga, someone needing joint-friendly padding, or simply want a reliable mat for home workouts, this one checks all the boxes.With its generous cushioning, lightweight portability, and multipurpose design, it's a solid addition to any fitness routine. It's also a great gift idea for anyone starting out in fitness or looking to upgrade from a thinner or worn-out mat.Highly recommended for comfort, quality, and value. 🧘‍♂️✨","R3H11ZRVH3UK4E",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5 people found this helpful","Delivers exceptional value and comfort","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H11ZRVH3UK4E/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01LP0U5X0","Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEWN3TWKVZZAQX6TYRIJLJZN3YNA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWN3TWKVZZAQX6TYRIJLJZN3YNA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Black","B01LP0U5X0","Color","Black",,,,

The benefit is I can also use this on the go like in dog training or when we go on training outings!So far though her nails have done some damage to it the mat has been very comfy and easy to clean if you're using it for your pets. The size is fantastic so if you'd want to use this for yoga I'd say this works for almost all heights! It's not very slippery but light enough to nudge with your feet if you need to. I can't speak to the support but my dog likes laying on it vs the floor (especially in cooler periods) so it must be more comfortable. She eats up beds so I'm waiting for her to grow out of it to have a bed in the living room as she doesn't sleep on the floor or her crate at night.As you can see her tail is going a mile a minute in the photo as she loves things for her and she loves being asked to do something if it makes her feel helpful! The photo was before i trimmed it in half but it's still got a great space range for an amstaff mix that's around 60 lbs even when cut in half if you want to use it as a crate mat or support/cushioning for a dog cot.Genuinely? I might actually buy this for myself to help with my knee injury exercises.","R3OELZPNRVNFSM","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GNrAxBLrL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"26 people found this helpful","Great as a dog training tool!

As a teacher, I need lots of water and I drink more when I have access to a straw.But this essentially replaces two water containers: it can replace my knock-off Stanley (which was hard to keep clean and only practical for teaching) and my regular water bottle I take on bike rides or hikes.I intentionally purchased the 40oz size because I go through about twice that in a day.

I kid you not, in the first week I was drinking 3-4 full bottles of water each day! That’s 120 oz to 160 oz of water per day which is mind boggling because before that I was struggling to finish at least to 32oz bottles. It’s all in the spout, whether you sip or chug, it is so easy to drink water without stopping. I was previously using a Camelbak Eddy+ and I loved that bottle but I found compared to the Owala the bite valve stopped you from getting a continuous flow of water between breathes.Plus it has a lid to cover the sip part which opens decently easy. I have found after the first few washes the lid catches when it goes to open, meaning it takes an extra second to pop open. It keeps the mouth piece clean even when dropped. If I dropped my Camelbak on the ground it would end up getting dirt, sand or mud depending on where it was dropped and the bite valve would need to be cleaned.The bottle comes apart and is easily cleaned.My main gripe is WHOEVER takes the product phots for Owala SUCKS!! Not once has a color way online matched what I have seen in store or received from an online order. If you want a particular color I recommend going to the store to pick it out and don’t rely on the product photos.Overall I highly recommend this bottle, I just wish the price was a bit lower and the colors were represented better.","R1Y34VUIKJP0CL",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","My New FAVORITE Bottle","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y34VUIKJP0CL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CV1F1W7K","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGAMVIKKKLSR2T7NMDH4X2DD5BXQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGAMVIKKKLSR2T7NMDH4X2DD5BXQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 40 Ounces, Color: Dreamy Field","B0CV1F1W7K","Size","40 Ounces","Color","Dreamy Field",,

It also keeps water cold for such a long time. Unfortunately, I've dented my bottle already by dropping it (about a metre drop), so it isn't the most dent-proof but you can always get a silicone boot to protect the bottom. After reading some reviews, I was worried that the bottle might come dented, but thankfully it was sent in a padded mailer and in great condition! My Owala literally comes everywhere with me now and I honestly can never go back to my other bottles. Although it may be a bit pricey, it is 100% worth the money as you'll get so much use out of it. Also reminder to take all the silicone bits out and wash them individually to keep everything clean! Definitely recommend this bottle if you haven't bought it already.","R1154A297WP34T",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Favourite Water Bottle!",,"Reviewed in Australia on July 18, 2024",,,,,"Size: 32 Ounces, Color: Iced Breeze","B0CV1F1W7K","Size","32 Ounces","Color","Iced Breeze",,

This kit has been an absolute game-changer for me, bringing my headlights back to life and making them look just like new again—without the need for power tools. After years of battling cloudy headlights, I can honestly say that this is one of the best products I’ve used for headlight restoration. Here’s why.🧽 No Power Tools Required – Easy to Use for Beginners and ProsOne of the first things I loved about the CERAKOTE® Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit is that it doesn’t require any power tools. Unlike other headlight restoration kits that demand power drills or polishing tools, this kit is as simple and straightforward as it gets. Everything you need to restore your headlights is included in the kit, and the process is easy to follow. Whether you’re a complete beginner or an experienced DIYer, you’ll find this kit to be incredibly user-friendly.The kit comes with 10 wipes—each wipe is individually sealed to keep it fresh until you’re ready to use it. The instructions are clear and simple, so you won’t be left guessing how to use the product. It’s a no-hassle solution that can be completed in the comfort of your own driveway or garage, saving you time and money compared to taking your vehicle to a professional.🌟 Restores Headlights to Like-New ConditionThe most impressive feature of the CERAKOTE® Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit is its ability to restore cloudy, yellowed, or foggy headlights to a like-new condition. I was honestly amazed at the transformation of my headlights after using this kit. They went from looking dull and hazy to being clear, bright, and crystal clear, which not only improved the aesthetics of my car but also enhanced my visibility while driving at night.The kit works by removing oxidation, grime, and dirt buildup from the surface of the headlights, followed by applying a ceramic coating that protects the headlights from further degradation. The result is headlights that look brand new—as if I just got them installed—giving my car a refreshed and well-maintained appearance.🛡️ Long-Lasting Protection with Ceramic CoatingAnother standout feature of the CERAKOTE® Headlight Restoration Kit is the ceramic coating it applies after restoring the headlights. The coating forms a protective layer that not only brings out the shine but also protects the headlights from UV rays, dirt, and water. This helps to prevent yellowing and cloudiness from reappearing, keeping your headlights looking new for a long time. The ceramic protection also helps repel water and keeps the headlights clear even after exposure to rain and moisture.The manufacturer claims that the results will last as long as you own your vehicle, and based on my experience, I believe it. The coating acts as a shield, preventing future oxidation, which is the main cause of yellowing and clouding of headlights. I’ve used other headlight restoration products in the past, but they only lasted a few months before the yellowing came back. With the CERAKOTE® Ceramic Kit, it feels like my headlights are permanently protected.🧴 Gentle Yet Effective – No Harsh Scrubbing RequiredUnlike other restoration kits that can require intense scrubbing or buffing, the CERAKOTE® Kit takes a gentler approach. The wipes included are formulated to be effective without requiring you to apply excessive force. The wipes are designed to remove oxidation, restore clarity, and apply the ceramic coating in a way that doesn’t damage the headlights or create unnecessary mess. Even if you’re dealing with headlights that have been neglected for a long time, this kit makes the restoration process feel easy and effortless.There’s no need to worry about abrasive tools or making a mess, as the wipes are disposable and won’t leave any residue or marks on your car. Simply wipe down the headlights, and you’re done! It’s easy to apply, and the whole process is completed within a short period—typically around 30 minutes per headlight.⚡ Instant Results – Fast and ConvenientWhen I used the CERAKOTE® Headlight Restoration Kit, the results were immediate. I could literally see the transformation happening right before my eyes. The wipes are saturated with just the right amount of solution to make the restoration process fast, and I didn’t have to wait for hours or deal with complicated steps. Within 30 minutes, both of my headlights were restored, and I was left with a car that looked like it had just been detailed.The fact that this is a quick and efficient process makes it perfect for those who are short on time or just looking for a DIY solution that doesn’t take all day.👌 Cost-Effective – Save Money on Professional Headlight RestorationOne of the most appealing aspects of the CERAKOTE® Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit is the cost savings. Professional headlight restoration services can be expensive, often costing anywhere from $100 to $150 per headlight. In comparison, this kit is affordable and allows you to restore your headlights yourself, at a fraction of the cost.Plus, you get 10 wipes in the kit, so you can use it for multiple vehicles or keep the extra wipes for future maintenance. This makes it a cost-effective investment for anyone looking to keep their headlights in great shape without the ongoing expense of professional services.🌈 Sleek and Convenient PackagingThe packaging is another thoughtful feature of the CERAKOTE® Headlight Restoration Kit. The individual wipes are neatly packaged and sealed, so they stay fresh and ready to use whenever you need them. The kit itself is compact and can easily fit in your car’s glove compartment, making it perfect for emergency headlight restoration while on the go.It’s also worth mentioning that the wipes are easy to store and don’t take up much space in your toolbox or garage, which adds to the convenience and portability of the product.✅ Final Thoughts – A Must-Have for Car OwnersThe CERAKOTE® Ceramic Headlight Restoration Kit has completely transformed the way I maintain my headlights. It’s an easy-to-use, effective, and long-lasting solution for restoring clarity and brightness to headlights, and the ceramic coating ensures the results last for years. I’ve already recommended this product to several friends and family members, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, high-quality headlight restoration kit.Whether your headlights have been affected by years of exposure to the elements or you just want to bring them back to life, this product will give you outstanding results. It’s a must-have for any car owner who wants to maintain their vehicle in top-notch condition and improve nighttime visibility.Five stars—I’m thoroughly impressed with the performance and convenience of this kit. It truly delivers on its promise to restore your headlights to like-new condition with long-lasting results!","R1U65FQI9XAL70",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11 people found this helpful","A Game-Changer for Restoring Headlights","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U65FQI9XAL70/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084RQKLV8","Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEWN3TWKVZZAQX6TYRIJLJZN3YNA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWN3TWKVZZAQX6TYRIJLJZN3YNA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 1 VEHICLE KIT","B084RQKLV8","Size","1 VEHICLE KIT",,,,

If so, there's still hope! If you have dealt with in the past or are currently dealing with this silent but frustratingly annoying problem, just know that you are not alone! You understand not only how terrible it looks but also more importantly how it can restrict the amount of light that shines through at night time while trying to drive! Well finally there is hope! Finally there is an inexpensive and unbelievably effective solution!So if you or a loved one understand the frustration of not being able to solve what seems like such a simple problem without using methods that require a ""professional"" to charge you ridiculous amounts of money for a solution that may or may not even work. Or if you've fallen victim to ""As seen on TV"" promises or that quirky yet engaging young man who approaches you at your local gas station with claims (and quite effectively to be fair) to be selling the ""next big thing"" in headlight restoration... THERE IS FINALLY AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION!!!Ok, all joking aside, plus I wanted to make sure I got your attention. First and foremost I could understand how this review may come across as some type of paid promotion or that I am gaining something from submitting such a lengthy review that unabashedly shows love to this amazing product. Well rest assured I am not! I am just your average dude who decided to give this product a shot because quite frankly nothing else works! The reviews for this ceramic headlight restoration kit we're very positive and provided me somewhat skeptical optimism but I figured all these other dudes and dudettes are showing pictures and talking about how great this product works that I figured for the price it was definitely inexpensive enough to give it a shot. Why not?! Over the years I've probably spent at least 15 to 20 times that amount trying to remedy this really annoying problem! Seriously folks it is an issue. If you have no one idea what I'm talking about and have never had to deal with it then you are very lucky, but if you're here reading reviews and thinking about buying this product then you just know. You just know that it can really make your car look dirty and old, but most importantly it can be a legitimate safety issue! If your headlights can get as foggy and yellow as mine it can seriously effect the amount of light my headlights are shining onto the road in front of me and to the cars coming towards me. That's pretty scary!  It has gotten so bad recently that I have questioned whether my headlights are even on or not because the lack of light shining from my headlights! That was when I decided to do yet another dive into finding a product that would actually work. Well I found it, and this Cerakote ceramic headlight restoration kit is the answer!A couple things of note when using/applying this product. Pay attention to the manner in which the instructions tell you to apply or scrub. The first step you're using a small circular motion with pressure, and then the second step you're supposed to use short back and forth strokes, and then the third step requires a different method of applying as well. I only mention this because it was easy for me to get distracted or lose focus and start using circular movements when I'm supposed to use back and forth movements or vice versa. The manner in which you do each step is important so keep that in mind.The most important thing I can suggest about this restoration kit, is to keep the faith! My headlight didn't look foggy after the first step as stated it would so that started making me skeptical that I've been had yet again, but stick with it! I stated above there were times where I kind of just lost focus and wasn't applying the cleaner or scrubbing the cleaner the proper way and then with my headlights not being foggy after step one I thought I was just kind of going through the motions and what was the point?! Even through me trying to sabotage the application and the cynical and skeptical thoughts creeping back in my head yet again this product still delivered way way above and beyond what I had hoped for! What I don't understand is how this product doesn't have five stars across the board and isn't promoted more heavily, because it is legit and it works!Trust me guys I get the frustration of product after product failing to come through, but this product delivered in every way possible and obviously I cannot recommend it enough!! If you're tired of your foggy, yellow headlights, or getting more and more nervous driving a night because the light projected in front of you seems to dissipate more and more over time. Just buy this headlight restoration kit!

It was pretty mild, so I never went to a dermatologist. However, before this time, never did I have to lotion my skin regularly, so this was a change for me.When this started happening, I used Aquaphor Healing Ointment (Advanced Therapy), and while it made me look greasy or like I was sweating for a couple hours, lol, it wore off enough, and would leave me looking normal the rest of the day. The only time my skin was really irritated was right after I would shave. However, dryness/peeling would get real bad if I did not at least lotion all those areas of my face after I showered. While I did some minor Googling about the issue, I was clearly too lazy to do anything about it, and the lotion solution sufficed for me. Dumb, I know.Anyways, fast forward to about 1.5 months ago. I started to notice a white growth under my left thumbnail that started to detach my nail from my nail bed. For some reason, this concerned me more than the dry skin on my face. So after Googling again, I found ti could be a problem with yeast growth under my nail. Then, I remembered reading that yeast growth could be causing my face problems. After connecting the dots, I decided to find a possible solution, to possibly kill two birds with one stone.After some searching, I stumbled onto Nizoral. After reading all the reviews, I was encouraged. I purchased this product and it has helped me tremendously. I could not be happier. It says to use it only every 3-4 days, which I say you should stick to, because I would use it on back to back days and it would seem to dry my skin out, but that could have been in my head.My Use:So, I know this is shampoo, but I almost treat it like liquid soap. I rub it on my skin/scalp and leave it there for 3-5 minutes. For my fingernail, I would lift it, since there was a gap and the nail was coming up. I put Nizarol directly in the ever so small opening between the nail and nail bed, and left it for 3-5 minutes. I am not sure if that was smart for the fingernail, but it worked for me.Results:TLDR: It worked everywhere, lol.Mouth/Upper Lip: This area was the worst of my dry skin issues. Like said, it was especially bad after shaving. Sometimes, my skin would be patchy red and inflamed after shaving, especially on the top of my chin and right below my lip. It would look gross for like an hour. In addition, when I did not shave, but did not lotion my skin, this area would eventually get pretty flaky before the end of the day. I also had issues with the corners of my mouth, especially after eating. My upper lip generally did not have any issues, but sometimes I would in very cold/dry weather.So, after using this product, I have seen a great deal of improvement. For the first time in almost 2 years, I do not have to lotion my face every single day. The patch below my lip still is not where I want it to be, but it is very much better. My skin feels dry after a shave, but now it does not look red or inflamed. It is getting better, and I think it will continue to get better. The corners of my mouth have issues if I do not lotion for 2 days or so, but they are much more minor to what they used to be. The minor issue above my lip is currently non-existent, however, we have not had any cold weather yet. This was the most noticeable problem I had with my dry/flaky/peeling skin, and I am happy to say, Nizarol has worked wonders. I now can use regular lotion instead of Aquaphor, which I still adore.Eyebrows: This was my second worse area, and I say eyebrows, but it was actually the area in between my eyebrows would flake worse than my eyebrows. I rub Nizarol into my eyebrows, in between them, and around my eye sockets. Nizarol has pretty much cleared up this issue, and I am thrilled Nizarol has basically eliminated the second worst dry area on my face. If I do not use lotion for several days, it does flake, but in a very minor way. Side note: be careful around your eyes, it burns pretty good if you get the shampoo runoff in your eye, lol.Nose/Nostrils: This was my third worst area. I would have dry skin on the sides of my nose, the point of my nose, and even on the inside of my nostrils! First off, putting Nizarol in your nostrils may not be safe. If you do do it, don't huff the Nizarol when it is in your nostrils, breath through your mouth. My nose area has improved, but is now more of an issue than my eyebrows. Still it is much better, and I can go a couple days without using lotion. It is also more of the inside of the nostrils than the outside of my nose. I think if I were willing to put Nizarol further up my nose than just the inside rim, I could eliminate the problem. But, at what cost? Lol. I don't want to ingest this stuff, lol. Either way, I am still happy!Head/Scalp: I have never had much of an issue with my scalp other than minor dandruff, for which I have always used Head & Shoulders. Despite this, I use this shampoo, as intended. I can not honestly tell if it is making any difference. Also, I have very short hair, so I cannot tell if this makes my hair coarse like everyone else says. If it does, I would use a conditioner like other reviews suggest.Ears/Earlobes:  So, while it was more rare, but sometimes, my ear lobes and the bottom crease where the ear connected to my face would get dry and flake. I rub Nizarol on my ears, on the inside of my ears, and behind my ears/ear lobes. I have zero issues here now and never have to lotion this area any more.Forehead/Cheek Areas:These were not really problem areas unless it was cold/dry/windy. We have not had that type of weather, but I really do not think it will be a problem.Pelvic Area: I know this is a touchy subject, lol, but  what I have to say is tame and could help some people. So several months back, something new happened, I noticed my pelvic area was dry as well, after using clippers. I used Nizarol in the creases of my leg, and in in my pelvic area, including directly on my -----. Results? Well, this has virtually eliminated the dry skin everywhere. Even better, I am chaffing less when running, which is awesome! I figured Nizarol was working everywhere else, so what the hell? Luckily for me, this was another minor issue it helped.Fingernail: Getting back to my fingernail, I had this white chalky/flaky formation under my fingernail. It had got to almost halfway down my thumbnail. It was causing my nail to lift. It did not hurt, but I thought it was unsightly. So I lifted the nail and put Nizarol in there. Again, possibly not safe, but a couple weeks in and my nail is almost back to normal. I eventually started cutting deeper into my nail to get the Nizarol farther back, which has worked. My nail almost looks normal and it looks like it is pushing the last of white to the font of my nail. So the growth stopped moving backward and it has improved. Another win!Others Uses?: As you can tell, I pretty much use this stuff all over. I put it on my elbows, the knuckles of my toes, and the point of my ankle bone. I think it is helping, but I am not 100% sure. What I can tell you is that it seems that it seems easier to get the dry skin off after applying the shampoo. A pedicure is on the docket and if I remember, I will update this review.Conclusion:Nizarol has worked way better than I could have hoped, and I did not even have to go to the dermatologist. I am hoping within a couple months, my skin will go back to normal. I am not sure if that will happen, but I love what Nizarol has done for me. I encourage anyone that has some of the issues I had to give it a try. Again, my issues were mild compared to some of the pictures I have seen, but I imagine if you are struggling with mild to intermediate issues, and you have not gone to a dermatologist, this could help you.I hope all this helps! Good luck!****Update: 7/25/2017***Fingernails: Nizoral completely fixed my nail problem!Face: So, when I first started using this product, I saw quite a bit of improvement. I no longer have red patches anywhere on my face. The only issue is that there have been diminishing returns. Nizarol has helped tremendously, but I still have dryness and dead skin issues. It is much more mild now, but still exists, however, I am grateful for the continued results.Scalp: Lol, I still cannot tell if this is helping or not. I still have minor dandruff. Nizarol has had no effect on my scalp as far as I can tell. Not a big deal for me though...","R2QAQSN7J9YZJ6",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1,723 people found this helpful","Attention Suffers of Mild Seborrheic Dermatitis and/or Psoriasis!!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QAQSN7J9YZJ6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AINMFAC","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2016",,,"amzn1.account.AH7Y5WFURXX3HE4AVYRIKM5TIZIQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7Y5WFURXX3HE4AVYRIKM5TIZIQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Scent: shampoo","B00AINMFAC","Scent","shampoo",,,,

I’m 37 and Had serious dandruff for months where it made me not even want to style my hair or even go anywhere. Right now I keep running my fingers through my hair it’s so refreshing. I washed my hair upside down with this shampoo, rinsed and washed again , rinsed. I didn’t like how dry and ruff it felt so I used a pack of argan oil deep conditioner for a minute then rinsed and my hair was amazing from the duo. My hair felt so light and nice even before completely air drying and I was hesitant to check it out until completely dry. But holy *********!!! This product removed all dandruff in 1 single wash session as directions were actuate saying wash,rinse , repeat.I do not see one single dandruff piece in my hair at all. And it was extreme to the point I am not exaggerating. I tried oils and conditioning before but nothing made it go away. I’m honestly not sure how my hair would feel without adding a deep conditioner afterwards but Walmart sells the one I used for less than $2 a packet. My hair now looks so refreshed and styled when all I did was let it air dry after using this dandruff shampoo and deep conditioner!! Trust me your be amazed at results! My hair can breathe again, it’s dandruff free, weightless, and full of life I’m so happy!! It doesn’t have a bad smell at all. Also you do not need a lot of shampoo at all as it lathered and foamed up thick while shampooing so well. I didn’t leave it in at all either. I’m surprised it’s not more expensive honestly and was really expecting to have to use it until bottle was empty not have it work just after one time.

I'm 36 now. At first it wasn't bad and then it got noticeable to the point I was embarrassed. For reference I have really dark brown hair, thick and very long. I had literally tried every kind of dandruff shampoo and conditioner from stores to online to salon recommended. From $5 bottles to $35 plus. The only way they would remotely work is if I used them daily, but by the end of the day or next morning, I'd have the ugly white flaking or white piece stuck in the middle of a strand of hair. If I went two days without using them, it would be enough to notice even with my hair in a bun And headband. And I usually wash my hair every 3-4 days because I never needed to wash it daily.I randomly searched on Amazon again about a month or two ago for dandruff shampoo because now it was getting itchy and I was so upset every day to see my hair. I found this product with high reviews, Nizoral. I said to myself, I'm desperate and I'll try anything. I purchased it. When I first went to use it, it was super blue and I wasn't sure how it would leave my hair, but I scrubbed it all around my scalp, only one wash. Then I used my normal conditioner, Nexxus, not any kind of anti dandruff conditioner (because I have those too). I wanted to see what the Nizoral would do without also having to use an anti dandruff conditioner. And for another reference (there's a lot of these), I first used it after not washing my hair for about 3-4 days, with only using dry shampoo in between. I got out of the shower and didn't see white flakes. I let my hair dry naturally as I wasn't going anywhere and drying it is a 30-40 minute process which I don't like doing lol. But I love my long hair; it's a love/hate relationship.Anyways, back to this magical shampoo, I woke up the next morning and no flakes, no white stuck in strands of my hair, no grossness falling out of my hair onto my sink or clothing when I ran my hands through my hair or brushed it, nothing! I was so excited, but hesitant because I said let's give this the day test. Checked back at night, nothing. Checked the next morning, nothing. I went 4 days without one single flake before my head was a little itchy because of just needing to be washed.I repeated the Nizoral shampoo with my normal conditioner again, and same thing. Days and no flakes or itching. I literally cried I was so happy and couldn't believe the type of sorcery this product had bestowed upon my head.I am now on month 2 or 3 I think, and I use this once a week with my regular conditioner and the dandruff is just gone. And that is days in between without washing my hair. It also doesn't make my hair dry or feel gunky or anything. My hair is always soft and smells nice. I was worried something like this would give off a weird medicated kind of smell, but not at all!If you have dandruff and nothing has worked or your tired of having to use something every day in order for it to work, just stop and buy this. It's not even that expensive and I have had two months of use from ONE bottle; again with that reference, I have hair down to my bum that takes 40 fricken minutes to dry with a blow dryer because it's so thick.Hands down I would literally promote this shampoo anywhere, even though my dandruff has been a really embarrassing condition for me. I wish I had before and after photos, but my dandruff was pretty much gone after the first use. So I couldn't even get a before picture now and it hasn't come back.Seriously, if you made it this far, Just buy it!** Also, quick footnote, I do shower daily. I just don't wash my hair every day. It goes up in a tight bun on my hair days off in the shower, which usually will stay up the rest of the day because I work from home and between being a single Mom getting a 7 year old up and ready for school and morning chores and then working for 10-12 hours, I'm too lazy to style my hair. Now, I do use a  normal dry shampoo in between hair washes. But I had that routine before I bought this product, so I know 100% the only reason my dandruff is gone is because of the Nizoral shampoo.*** Second footnote, I'm not being paid to write this nor was this some kind of promotional item I got to use to write about. I'm just that impressed and so happy with the results and I know there has to be someone else out there that is going through that struggle I did and I just want that person to feel the happiness I do right now.**** This is the longest review I've ever written in my life.","R2UQFJQ9UAAO0W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"906 people found this helpful","Just Buy It!!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UQFJQ9UAAO0W/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AINMFAC","Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2022",,,"amzn1.account.AEB6CC5XZVMCQN6CHAPMN6S6DXQA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEB6CC5XZVMCQN6CHAPMN6S6DXQA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Scent: shampoo","B00AINMFAC","Scent","shampoo",,,,

I wash my hair every Monday and Thursday, they always get oily and has this white oily buildup when I scratch my hair.

It’s an overnight hydrogel mask, meaning it is meant to be applied before bed and left on overnight for maximum benefits. Here’s a detailed review of the mask based on its features and user feedback:Key Features:1. Hydrating Overnight Formula: The mask is designed to be left on overnight, allowing the active ingredients to deeply hydrate and rejuvenate the skin while you sleep. It’s formulated with bio-collagen and hydrogel to ensure moisture retention and skin nourishment throughout the night.2. Pore Minimizing: One of the claims of this product is its ability to reduce the appearance of pores. The mask helps refine skin texture by moisturizing deeply and tightening the skin surface, which can give pores a more minimized look over time.3. Elasticity Improvement: The bio-collagen in the mask is designed to boost skin elasticity, improving the overall firmness and resilience of the skin. This may be especially beneficial for those concerned with signs of aging or loss of firmness.4. Hydrogel Technology: The mask uses a hydrogel base that allows for better absorption of the active ingredients compared to traditional sheet masks. It adheres closely to the skin, creating a barrier that prevents the ingredients from evaporating and ensures prolonged hydration.5. Gentle & Non-Irritating: The formula is designed to be gentle on the skin, making it suitable for most skin types, including sensitive skin. It is free from harsh chemicals and artificial fragrances, which can often irritate delicate skin.Pros:• Deep Hydration: Users report that their skin feels incredibly moisturized and plump after using the mask, especially in the morning. The hydrogel technology helps lock in moisture overnight.• Improved Skin Texture: Many find that after consistent use, the mask helps improve skin texture, making the skin feel smoother and softer. The pore-minimizing effect is also noticeable for some users.• Elasticity & Firmness: Regular use is said to contribute to more elastic and firmer skin, particularly beneficial for those dealing with early signs of aging or skin laxity.• Non-Greasy & Absorbs Well: The gel-based texture is lightweight and non-greasy, which makes it comfortable to sleep in without worrying about residue or discomfort on the pillow.• Suitable for Sensitive Skin: It’s designed with sensitive skin in mind, and many users with sensitive or acne-prone skin have found it to be gentle and non-irritating.Cons:• Price: Depending on where it’s purchased, the mask may be considered on the pricier side, especially given that it’s an overnight treatment that may need to be used multiple times to see visible results.• Effectiveness May Vary: While many users report positive results, others may not notice a dramatic change in pore size or skin elasticity immediately, especially if they have more significant skin concerns.• Can Be Messy: As with some hydrogel masks, the texture can sometimes be a bit slippery, making it prone to sliding off during the night. Users need to ensure they apply it evenly and securely.• Not for Everyone: Although generally well-tolerated, there’s always the possibility that those with specific allergies or skin conditions may experience a reaction. Patch-testing before use is recommended.User Feedback:• Positive: Many users rave about how their skin feels soft, hydrated, and refreshed the morning after using the mask. It’s especially popular for people with dry skin or those looking to boost hydration levels during the colder months.• Mixed: Some users have noted that while the mask is hydrating, they didn’t experience a dramatic reduction in pore size or significant improvements in elasticity. However, others found that these benefits became more noticeable with consistent use over a few weeks.Final Thoughts:The BIODANCE Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask is a promising skincare treatment for those looking to hydrate, improve skin elasticity, and minimize pores. Its overnight hydrogel formula is convenient and effective for moisturizing the skin deeply while you sleep. While it may be slightly more expensive than other options, many users find it to be a worthwhile addition to their nighttime skincare routine, particularly for dry or aging skin. However, as with any product, results may vary, so it’s best to give it consistent use over time to see its full benefits.","RK27E5TUJ4WFT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"90 people found this helpful","My pores are gone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK27E5TUJ4WFT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B2RM68G2","Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AHYUERHGISLVDJ7YSQC5XFGRYXQQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYUERHGISLVDJ7YSQC5XFGRYXQQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 4 Count (Pack of 1), Color: Collagen Mask","B0B2RM68G2","Size","4 Count (Pack of 1)","Color","Collagen Mask",,

This is one of the only face masks I've found that leaves my face so soft and hydrated, I don't need to worry about any flaking or reapplication of lotion on a daily basis.There is a learning curve when you apply the mask. It's very fragile (I poked more than one nail hole into the first one I used) and also very slippery. I suggest applying the bottom part first, then layering the top over it. If you apply 2 hours before bedtime, it will stay in place, and it will not stain your bedding. I have been able to sleep comfortably every time I've used it (which has been on a regular since I found it.) I've been giving these to all my friends to try too.If you're on the fence, just try it.

The skin on my face is sensitive and have fair skin. The skin under and above my eyes has become thin. I have blue lines, eye bags, rosacea, some acne scars areas of melasma along my cheek bones.My skin looks so good after using this! The directions are easy. You open it,  Apply to 2 parts of the mask. It also has 3 small ovals where the lips and eyes are located that can be removed and applied to problem areas under the mask. The two larger pieces of the mask do cover most of my face but there is the areas above the eys and above the lips that could be covered better but you could apply those small patches to these spots. The recommendation is to wear it to bed. Mask starts off white the becomes clear. I have worn it to bed but also just worn it for a few hours and either way, my skin looks and feels amazing after.These are great and the skin on my face and under my eyes looks so much better.

These WeatherBeaters, on the other hand, provide a more consistent pressure across the blade, resulting in a cleaner and more thorough wipe.The fact that they ""Meet Or Exceed OEM Quality And Durability Standards"" also gives peace of mind regarding their longevity. Installation was straightforward, and they've performed reliably in various weather conditions since I installed them.If you're like me and appreciate a wiper blade that maintains even contact across the glass, avoiding the center streaks that can sometimes occur with the edge-focused pressure of beam blades, the Rain-X WeatherBeater is definitely worth considering.","R2F1T4UIXDQGHQ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"One person found this helpful","A reliable wipe in all weather","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F1T4UIXDQGHQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084CVBJDF","Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFDJMYKKRRPPFYL5WES7GUOVNJ7Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDJMYKKRRPPFYL5WES7GUOVNJ7Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 20"", Style: Pack of 1","B084CVBJDF","Size","20""","Style","Pack of 1",,

On my earlier cars it was just a long thin strip of rubber that (sometimes with two thin strips of steel support down each side) that one would reply.I was suspicious at the whole idea of needing to reply a the entire metal blade holder just to get new wipers. In my ignorance I ordered these new Rain-X ""blades"". I'm happy with the new blades, in that they perfectly, no noice, perfectly remove the water, etc. I can't comment on the longevity, as I've only had them on a few days.BUT HERE'S THE CATCH. This is daylight robbery. It's a huge waste of money and resources. How on Earth did the automotive industry get away with making car owners replace the entire blade holder (which is very solidly made out of steal), which is perfectly fine, just to get a tiny little strip of new rubber?It's the equivalent of having to change the entire wheel (hub and all) every time you need a new tire. That would never be acceptable.After cringing at the fact I was now the owner of wasteful and expensive wiper blade arms / holders that have little purpose except to go into landfill, I did some digging around. Yes, thankfully, It is possible to buy just the rubber (or silicone) strip, and install it into an existing blade arm / holder. One option I see here on Amazon goes for around AU$22 for 4 (https://amzn.to/460FYe6). They are referred to as ""wiper REFILLS"". Failing to put ""refill"" into the search will likely result in only seeing expensive full blade and blade holder replacements like this product from Rain-X.Welcome to the world of car part scams and cons, for the ignorant (as I was).","R16VYJ5SGD39JB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Great blades, but what a waste!",,"Reviewed in Australia on September 11, 2023",,,,,"Size: 26"" and 16"", Style: Pack of 2","B084CVBJDF","Size","26"" and 16""","Style","Pack of 2",,

I love how it buffs away all the dry, flaky skin on my legs and elbows, leaving everything incredibly smooth. The shea butter in the formula balances the exfoliation by providing deep moisture, so my skin feels both polished and nourished after use.What impressed me most is that the moisture actually lasts. Unlike other scrubs I've tried that leave my skin feeling dry again within hours, the hydration from this Tree Hut scrub keeps my skin soft well into the next day. I've even been able to cut back on body lotion on the days I use this.The jar is generous in size and a little goes a long way, making it excellent value. I've been using it twice weekly for about a month and have barely made a dent in the container.For anyone looking to elevate their shower experience while getting truly effective exfoliation, I can't recommend the Tree Hut Vanilla Shea Sugar Scrub enough.

It’s a perfect blend of sweet raspberry with a fizzy, slightly citrusy kick that makes your shower smell like a refreshing fruity soda. It’s not overly perfumed or artificial—just fresh, fun, and uplifting. The scent lingers softly on your skin after use, which a lot of people (including me!) love.The texture is exactly what I’ve come to expect from Tree Hut. It has that thick, gritty sugar consistency that makes exfoliating satisfying without being too harsh. It scrubs away dead skin cells well and leaves your skin noticeably softer and smoother. It also contains nourishing ingredients like shea butter, which helps keep your skin moisturized—not dry or stripped after rinsing.The shimmer is subtle but cute. Some people mentioned they noticed a light sparkle left on their skin, which adds a nice, summery glow. It’s not glittery or over-the-top, just a tiny bit of fun if you like that extra touch.Now, the one downside: the size. This particular scent comes in a smaller tub than the usual 18 oz Tree Hut scrubs—more like 8.4 oz. Many reviews mention being surprised or disappointed by the smaller size, especially since the price is still fairly high. It’s definitely not a great value if you’re expecting the same amount as the standard jars. If you're someone who uses scrubs regularly, you'll go through this one pretty fast.Final Verdict: 4/5 stars.The Raspberry Fizz scrub is delightful in scent and performance—it leaves your skin smooth, fresh, and smelling great. But be aware of the size before you buy. It’s perfect if you want to try something fun or give a cute gift, but maybe not the best deal for everyday use.","R24MPTUO3MXQIH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11 people found this helpful","good but small","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24MPTUO3MXQIH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BX2TZZWG","Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEBJ5QZJRGZCXQQIK4GHF42AUCNQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEBJ5QZJRGZCXQQIK4GHF42AUCNQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Scent: Raspberry Fizz","B0BX2TZZWG","Scent","Raspberry Fizz",,,,

I ended up using it in my dad's work truck to really put it to the test. He is working in a very dusty area with the red dirt....his truck was covered in the thick dust, so a perfect test of the product. He and I cleaned what we could with rags, but I wanted to try this stuff out on the creases and vents. It worked alright. Here are the pros/cons of the product from my initial test:Pros:- Ease of use: This is very easy to use. Just open it up, pull it out, and start dabbing it into the dusty areas. I found that tapping the dust to get the worst of it off before dragging it over a second time worked best.- Cleaning: This is good for loose dust. It worked really well at removing the dust in the vents and some of the corners you could not get a rag into.Cons:- Cleaning: This did not remove some of the stuck on dust that a rag would have removed. I also found that getting in tighter crevices did not work very well either. It also left a little greasy feel that may attract dust or that some people may not like on their dashes or inside their vehicles.- Cleaning the product: With as heavy of dust that was in my dad's truck, the gel got pretty dirty. I am not sure the best way to clean it, or if you can even clean it. Rags and towels are easy...just throw them into a washing machine. I'm guessing this is use until completely dirty and throw away.- Messy: This also leaves a greasy feel to your hands. With rags, you can usually minimize this, but this stuff gets all over your fingers, especially the finger you use to press it into vents.Overall, this is something that is a neat idea, but it really is not great. It worked okay at getting loose dirt and dust off of surfaces, but you could also get the same results from using something like tape or wrapping a small tool with some cloth and using cleaning agents. This might make a cheap, fun stocking stuffer if you want to get something that is different. Personally, I don't think I'll buy this again and just use rags.","R28UOTC40OAF5Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"627 people found this helpful","An Alright Dust Remover","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28UOTC40OAF5Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081T7N948","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2022",,,"amzn1.account.AEA7XIJODZYBRBKGWU5BBST4BPOQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEA7XIJODZYBRBKGWU5BBST4BPOQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B081T7N948",,,,,,

Figured it would be something different and fun at the same time. They all raved about them and thought they were awesome. So I had to try them for myself and get some for me!This putty gets into all those weird tiny cracks and hard to reach crevices. it doesn't leaves any residue or weird marks on any of the surfaces that I tried in my car. I obviously didn't try it on the audio screen or clock. The instructions say not to do so which totally makes sense.Some reviews say it leaves hands slimy, I didn't experience that. It has a different feel to it, like a silly putty feel.There isn't really any directions for cleaning the product. So I choose to try something out. I took some heavy duty paper towels and ran it under warm water, rang it out pretty well. I opened up the paper towels and laid out on the counter. I took the putty and quickly rolled it around the wet paper towel. It really cleaned off most of the dirt and all the larger particles the putty had stuck to it. I did not soak the putty in water. Just a few quick rolls around the paper towel. after i did that, I put it back into the air tight jar it came in. After a few days, I opened it up to use it again and it worked the same way it did the first time! It wasn't dried out or anything. Still picked up dust and particles like before.I was happy with this product. I would recommend this to anymore that likes to keep the surfaces in their car clean on a daily basics. I am not sure how well this putty would do on like extremely dirty surfaces and used more frequently on those heavily soiled surfaces. But for me this was a great purchase at a great price and perfect for my need in my car!","R2THEOQ4U92E53",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"12 people found this helpful","I love this cleaning putty!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2THEOQ4U92E53/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081T7N948","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGPKJFYGCMSSHAAFIA4IFDWXSWZA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPKJFYGCMSSHAAFIA4IFDWXSWZA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B081T7N948",,,,,,

Make sure the gel is cold, not warm, not hot. The warmer it is the more liquid it'll be, and the messier things will get.2. When you're cleaning things with spaces (like fan vents or keyboard keys) or things with holes, I placed the gel on it and pushed it gently, then waited for 5-10 seconds for the gel to seep into the spaces.DON'T LEAVE IT IN FOR MORE THAN 10 SECONDS! Otherwise you risk it going in too far and getting stuck inside.3. Rely on the fact that the gel sticks to itself more than anything else. If a few pieces get stuck between spaces, dont try to pull them out with your fingers. Use the rest of the gel and make it have contact with the pieces of gel for a few seconds before yanking out the entire thing. It should pull the pieces with it.4. Whenever you're trying to pull it out, try to either yank it up as one piece, or slide it in one direction so that it doesn't rip in one side.At first, I just dabbed it on the fan, and it didn't seem to do much, until I actually let it sit for a few seconds before peeling it off. This made the dust and lint pieces adhere to the gel.","R2C0HSLZBCIYQ5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing!",,"Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on June 20, 2023",,,,,"","B081T7N948",,,,,,

After trying all scents I have a solid ranking that can help others.1. Fresh & Cozy2. Strawberry Dream (Fresh & Cozy and Strawberry Dream are interchangeable but Fresh & Cozy seems more universal and versatile)3. Coconut Waters (Coconut Waters was 4th before because Pink Champagne is more exotic smelling and I’m trying to give a more universal rating but it’s definitely more my personality so I had to switch it.)4. Pink Champagne5. Vanilla Cashmere6. Jasmine Peach7. Pomegranate Raspberryeos Shea Better Fresh & Cozy Moisture Body LotionMorning light, dewy cassis and sheer muskThe fragrance of “Fresh & Cozy” is so simple yet anything but underwhelming. When you focus on the scent, it, to me, is the epitome of comfort. I highly appreciate it. This is the best out of the ones I’ve tried for the versatility. It’s not the loudest scent out of the line. It’s also not prettiest or overtly feminine scent in the world. But it’s the prettiest universal “clean”/low key scent I’ve ever smelled. It’s like pretty linens not just linens and that is obviously attributed to the cassis. I don’t have anything as refreshing yet feminine as this. Makes no sense how comforting it smells.eos Shea Better Strawberry Dream Moisture Body Lotionsparkling strawberry, pink sugar, and vanilla creamI initially was disappointed by this scent because the strawberry note is not as strong as I was expecting and it doesn’t last on the skin but this is the best scent for my body chemistry and i really like the slightly creamy pink sugar smell that remains for hours, even until the next day, on my skin! It makes me feel really cute yet it’s not immature to me! It is BY FAR the longest lasting fragrance out of the ENTIRE line on me and It’s actually my favorite now after prolonged use. I get it now I was just impatient. I wanted to make it #1 but everyone’s taste is different.eos Shea Better Pink Champagne Moisture Body Lotionpear champagne, ruby pomegranate & plum suedejuicy, different. pretty. feminine. I had my mom put it on and it reaffirmed my opinion of it. the sillage and projection is much stronger on her. Smells very good and exotic. I haven’t always been into scented lotions so the notes in this are very intriguing to me. It’s just so good! It’s notes are loud and distinct on my skin yet the overall exotic scent doesn’t last as long on me. this definitely can be in 3rd place. but it’s not as versatile for my personality. It’s VERY pretty and unique. It doesn’t stand out on my skin as distinctly or as long as Strawberry Dream. It actually leaves my skin in an hour and what remains is a sheer pear/plum musky smell for an additional hour. Interesting. I don’t like categorizing scents by seasons but it definitely gives off summer vibes. I’m a Autumn/Winter girl.eos Shea Better Coconut Waters Moisture Body Lotioncreamy coconut, lush hibiscus and solar muskI am most surprised by this lotion as I tried to stay away from coconut scented products because they always smell like piña colada. I don’t want anything tropical. Like I mentioned before I love milky and creamy scents and I was hoping it would smell like coconut milk and for now this is as close as I’ll get. it is more creamy and musky than tropical and it’s overall really pretty. I like it more than Pink Champagne and wear it more. So creamy! The hibiscus in this definitely helps it. I find this to be more interesting than the vanilla cashmere as that one to me just smells like caramel. I also put a baby oil on top of this and i’m telling you it smells so creamy and yummy.eos Shea Better Vanilla Cashmere Moisture Body Lotionwhipped vanilla, soft musk and cozy caramelI love vanilla, I love cream, I love milk scents. This isn’t bad but I can see how someone sensitive to scented products would smell burnt plastic instead of caramel. It’s more caramel than vanilla. Surprisingly my least favorite. A true vanilla lotion would be the one from The Lotion Company. That one is straight vanilla bean. The caramel isn’t cozy to me and is too sweet. A very gummy burnt (not in a bad way) caramel scent. I like smelling like a snack but it’s a bit too much for me. It actually gives me a headache. There’s nothing soft or cozy about this. I think I find this to smell a bit too juvenile for me. It’s clearly about personal taste. I know many adults who like this. I think teenager every time I smell it. Strawberry Dream has a creaminess mixed into so I can take it a bit more seriously i guess.eos Shea Better Jasmine Peach Moisture Body Lotionapricot nectar, sparkling jasmine, and vanilla sugarI was looking for some thing similar to the Johnson baby lotion in the pink bottle but without the green leafy note. It’s a bit feminine, but not powdery and babyish. You get more jasmine than peach. It’s basically jasmine with a sour undertone. It’s, so far, the least impressive out of the bunch. it’s also a bit screechy/pissy on me sometimes. Fresh & Cozy is stronger and lasts longer than this. The smell goes so fast and it’s not even that noticeable so I’m returning. I keep going nose blind to it. When I do smell it I’m just sure you can find something stronger and less simple at bath and body works and i don’t even shop there. It’s just not that good and I personally like jasmine as a fragrance note in perfumes. My mother likes it. It smells like grandma to me and I usually like scents that lean more sensual and/or mature.eos Shea Better Pomegranate Raspberry Moisture Body Lotionluscious pomegranate blended with tart raspberries and lotus blossomIt’s not bad. It’s not for my personality. Unlike Jasmine Peach, you can smell this one easily. Not interested in tart scents but thought I’d try anyway. It reminds me of a scent of hand sanitizer I would’ve gotten from bath and body works. It’s an average lotion scent and it’s not bad. Not my choice. if Jasmine Peach Was better I would prefer it over this if I was forced to choose.~ OLD Update: I raised it a star. I like strawberry dream but when it dries it’s just pink sugar. Not much cream. no strawberry. It’s cute. not that interesting but my nose welcomed the smell a bit more and i won’t return it. i’m not *AS* disappointed. ~OLD REVIEW ~It’s more sugar and cream and hardly any strawberry. I can’t believe I like Pink Champagne more than Strawberry Dream. It’s not bad but it smells like sugar cookies or biscuits. I was hoping for a strawberry cupcake vibe. There’s no strawberry once rubbed in. You only smell it right out of the bottle. For Pink Champagne I give it 4.5 stars because although I don’t usually like fruity smells, plum is not that common of a fragrance note for me to associate it with anything childish or juvenile. Plum and pear smell quite good. Lol i’m only 23 but i don’t like smelling like Skittles. I really don’t regret buying that one! Especially because I have others in my collection so it’s a good addition. Vanillas, milks, and cream scents are really nice and Strawberry Dream is a basic sugary scent that I’m unimpressed by. Disappointing. It doesn’t smell bad it’s just not as interesting or strong as the other lotions. Even Fresh and Cozy is more unique than this. Good thing is these lotions are the only lotions I feel that don’t leave my skin dry or absorb instantly. It leaves a bit of lubrication behind on the skin and not just a thin “dry” layer of oil. A nice silky finish on the skin. Comfortable and good value.","R1NK8EHTRDZ78K",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"504 people found this helpful","Not a Strawberry Dream —> Ranking All Scents","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NK8EHTRDZ78K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08KT2Z93D","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AHWMGC34NWZL6GLRAG24QCX7SMHQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHWMGC34NWZL6GLRAG24QCX7SMHQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Scent: Strawberry Dream, Size: 16 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","B08KT2Z93D","Scent","Strawberry Dream","Size","16 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)",,

The lotion itself is very nice, it is very hydrating and moisturizing to the hands! But there is not that signature fragrance, but I found in the body lotion! This one has absolutely no scent whatsoever to me, you have to really stick your nose up on it when it's on your hands to even get a tiny with of anything! So for that reason I will not be repurchasing this! Since the whole reason I'm buying it is because I wanted that strong vanilla cashmere fragrance, that I have found to love in the body lotion that I use daily! But I will also give a warning as far as the body lotion goes, the ones I buy in the store have that Heavenly fragrance, when I have ordered them offline here on Amazon they do not have that same smell! As a matter of fact the one that I bought last time here on Amazon the body lotion, it had a almost plastic nasty smell! The bottle was also damaged, so I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement! The replacement was in much better condition as far as the packaging goes, and the fragrance was a little bit there, but not like it is when I buy it in the store! I'm not sure why that is? I don't know if it's because they're older products? Or if it's because they're knock-offs possibly? Or if it's because of where they're they're keeping them in storage? I really don't know why it is it's very odd! Either way I'll continue to buy it at the store, and I will avoid buying that product here on amazon! Because the fragrance once again is the whole reason that I'm purchasing it, there are plenty of body lotions that give you that moisture and hydration that you need, but I buy this one specifically for the fragrance only! I have also read and found that, supposedly they have changed or are in the process of changing the formulation because some people were whining about the fragrance being too strong! IF that is the case, I will no longer be buying this product because for some of us it is the fragrance that we are buying it for! The whole purpose some of us buy these products, is because we're looking for that strong fragrance that will linger on our body all day! And when you find the right one with this brand, you absolutely get that! But just be careful where you purchase it! Even at the store I highly recommend that you open the bottle and stick your nose to it! Because you want to make sure you're getting the one that actually has that strong fragrance, if you're in it for the fragrance only like myself! As far as everything else the formulation is very nice very hydrating very moisturizing I can't complain on those points!

I’ve tried several body lotions over the years, but this one really stands out. From texture to scent to how my skin feels hours later — it checks all the boxes.Scent (5/5):The vanilla fragrance is warm, cozy, and not overpowering. It reminds me of a soft cashmere sweater on a cool day — hence the name, I assume! There’s a hint of sweetness, but it’s balanced and sophisticated, not overly sugary or artificial like some vanilla products can be. It lingers just enough to feel fresh and feminine without clashing with my perfume.Texture and Absorption (5/5):The lotion is rich but not greasy. It spreads easily and sinks into my skin within seconds. I can get dressed almost immediately after applying it, which is a big win. It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and moisturized without any sticky residue.Hydration (5/5):This is where it really shines. My skin stays soft all day long, even in dry weather. I’ve noticed a visible improvement in texture, especially on my elbows and knees, where I’m usually the driest. It feels like my skin is drinking it in, and the softness lasts well into the next day.Packaging (4.5/5):The bottle design is sleek and fits easily in my hand or on a bathroom shelf. The pump works well and dispenses just the right amount. My only tiny gripe is that I wish it were a little more eco-friendly or refillable — but that’s me being picky.Final Thoughts:Whether you’re looking for something to combat dry skin or just want to smell amazing all day, I highly recommend giving EOS Cashmere Vanilla a try. It feels like self-care in a bottle — luxurious, comforting, and clean.

Whether you're dealing with a dead battery or need a backup power source, this device is a solid investment for any driver looking for peace of mind on the road.","R216NUXF336ECP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5 people found this helpful","Small but powerful","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R216NUXF336ECP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015TKUPIC","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGPVXOEQBBQZLGMW2BEYF4BIGWNA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPVXOEQBBQZLGMW2BEYF4BIGWNA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B015TKUPIC",,,,,,

    Just wow! I was spring cleaning and got to my car. It had been sitting over winter and the battery fully died so I would have needed help. This thing is AMAZING!!! Sadly, I couldn’t capture it correctly since I had started it already, but I wanted to show how quick it works. I showed in the video that my car lights weren’t even turning on (shows just how dead the battery was). How the device is supposed to work is how it did in the video. Originally I was a special case. When I hooked up the cables, the lights didn’t cycle. If you are connected properly, hold the (!) button to override the safety and try starting now. That is what I had to originally do. If in the other case like in the video, the battery is dead but not entirely drained so it works as intended. I used it a few times getting the video properly and it still has 4bars (full battery). I appreciate how small and portable the device is. You could almost mistake it for a regular power brick if it weren’t for the text on the device. Overall, I would purchase it again, but I doubt I will ever need to. It will probably outlive me!My unit didn’t come with instructions so I had to look them up… Here is what to do in detail:1) Check if car will start without help2) If car won’t start, open hood of vehicle3) Take NOCO jumper and attach jumper adapter to device4) Connect clamps to car battery terminals, black-to-black and red-to-red (order doesn’t matter since the clamps are not powered yet)5) Turn the NOCO device on6) The white light below the power indication bar should turn solid and the power indicator lights should start to cycle6.5.1) If the clamps are connected properly and the previous step didn’t happen (power lights stayed solid and no white light), then either you didn’t connect properly or the battery is below 2v (completely dead). In this case you need to override the unit to force to start the process. Hold the (!) button for a few seconds6.5.2) The white light previously mentioned will flash instead of stay solid and the power indicator lights will cycle7) Attempt to start vehicle7.5.1) Vehicle should start without delay. If it doesn’t, your battery’s terminals might have corrosion on them interfering with the connection of the device. Power off the device and remove the clamps, in that order7.5.2) Clean the corrosion off the battery’s terminals7.5.3) Start again from step 48) Let the vehicle stay on to charge battery.9) Turn off the NOCO and remove the clamps, in that order10) Store NOCO device as desired, preferably in its included drawstring pouch and in a cool, dry location11) Either drive the vehicle for a while or turn the vehicle off after some time to save up some battery charge for later","R389U6LYGB91XT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"25 people found this helpful","WOW!!!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R389U6LYGB91XT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015TKUPIC","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHOSQH3LQ5LG76QHZUQTJDRSA5KA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHOSQH3LQ5LG76QHZUQTJDRSA5KA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B015TKUPIC",,,,,,

Así que voy a dar mi opinión con base en eso y no a los resultados porque apenas me llegó ayer.Lo pedí con mucha inseguridad ya que en muchos comentarios se menciona que es falso principalmente por el código azul que tienen las botellas de The Ordinary. Pero ayer que me llegó investigué en YouTube y en blogs en línea.  La caja debe de ser de un material que se siente aterciopelado al tacto y el blanco es un blanco mate muy suave, y de un cartón más duro que por ejemplo una cartulina, la línea gris de la caja y de la botella son de un gris brillante pero igual aterciopelado. El código azul ya no es un indicio, ya que según algunas chicas que compran estos productos constantemente mencionan que The Ordinary cambia sus empaques después de cierto tiempo y el código de serie puede venir tanto en azul como en negro y en diferentes posiciones, lógicamente porque la producción se tiene que ir renovando. Uno se da cuenta en la tipología de la letra  que de hecho no debe ser irregular en ciertas partes de la caja. Es decir uno ve cuando las letras están chuecas o barridas de ahí uno se da cuenta inmediatamente. El que me llegó ayer incluso tiene una etiqueta que fue distribuido por Sephora México que hasta donde sé es la principal en traer a México la marca. Así que si me lo preguntan no hagan mucho caso a esas reseñas de que si el código azul y el código de barras está en otra posición etc. Porque lo repito The Ordinary no se queda con un solo diseño por más de un año pero hay patrones que claramente pueden ayudar a decir si es original o no como por ejemplo lo aterciopelado de la caja blanca. Así que por ahora puedo decir que si es original o al menos eso es lo que se ve, huele y se siente.En cuanto use el producto más tiempo ya daré mi opinión si funciona o no.Saludos","R185N94DYSV3RZ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dudas: Original o falso.",,"Reviewed in Mexico on July 3, 2022",,,,,"Size: 8.11 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","B071914GGL","Size","8.11 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)",,,,

My purchased new CRV has over 145,000 miles, & to be honest my oil change intervals were too far apart in earlier years.  It wasn't taken care of well enough then, trying to reduce wear and extend vehicle life now as long as possible.  MPG is not as good as with Mobil1, but 2 years (4 oil changes) of oil change analysis from BlackStone Labs shows sub 5PPM metal(s) per 1,000 miles, which is considered a good level of engine wear for a vehicle after break-in.  I'm changing this oil every 6 months, and approximately 6,000 miles.  Oil change analysis shows I could go longer, but I don't want to.  Low cost quality motor oil I can affordably change every 6 months, along with a Mobil 1 M1-110A Extended Performance Oil Filter.  Oil analysis shows this is a good combination on a car that wasn't given enough love earlier on in it's life.

I was just hoping for a little fun sparkle on my lashes, but it actually turned out way better than I thought.Here’s what I learned while playing around with it. If you use it like regular mascara and just comb it through your lashes, it gives you a really subtle shimmer. It’s pretty, especially during the day or if you want something low-key. But if you want that glitter to actually show up, the trick is to press the wand gently against your lashes instead of brushing it through. I know it sounds a little weird, but it makes a huge difference. Just kind of press and blink, then press again, and suddenly your lashes look like they were kissed by fairy dust.Also, let each coat dry before going in with more. Same goes for your base mascara if you're layering it. I didn’t wait the first time and it got a little messy. Now I take my time and it applies so much better.The sparkle shows up the most in direct light. Like, if you shine your phone flashlight or catch sunlight just right, you can really see it twinkle. In regular daylight you can still see it, it’s just a lot softer. So it depends on the lighting, but I love that you can kind of choose how bold or subtle it looks.I seriously had so much fun trying this out and now I’m obsessed. Definitely recommend pairing it with your favorite mascara, but on it's own, it's cute too. It make my lashes look so pretty, and it just makes me feel extra cute.","R3GM7ZJBHH7XUY",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"19 people found this helpful","Glitter lashes are my new favorite thing!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GM7ZJBHH7XUY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08H3JPH74","Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEM5CVMDUEC4SKY5WT74ZWAIDAQQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEM5CVMDUEC4SKY5WT74ZWAIDAQQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: SPACE DIAMOND, Size: 0.24 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","B08H3JPH74","Color","SPACE DIAMOND","Size","0.24 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)",,

Any peal off lipstain is tricky to work with and can make a mess. Yess it gets on your teeth if you're applying all over. You do have to brush your teeth when you're done. It wont come off it one clean peal if you apply all over because it wasn't intended to be used all over. It comes off in one clean peal if you're using it as a liner only and allow it to dry completely. If you have alot of peach fuzz on your upper lip, it will pull your hair if you over line. Obviously. It you have dry skin pealing on your lips, it will pull on it if your applying it over it. Obviously. Some of these reviews are like...... really?!? I mean come on. There's a reason it advises to clean and exfoliate before use. If your lips are pealing, don't use it at all unless you're ready for a little sting. If used correctly, this product is fantastic!!! There are different types of skin around our lips and the stain will last different amounts of time depending on where you're applying it. The outer area where we line holds stain longer than the middle areas of our lips. The closer you get to the inside of your mouth, the less it's able to hold a stain. That has NOTHING to do with the stain and everything to do with your skin. I use this product all over my lips. I have learned (over the last 6 months of using it) that it works it's absolute best if you don't overline much. Remember, the skin above our lip is different than the skin of our lip! If you clean your lips and exfoliate as directed, apply a thin THICK line along the actual lip line, let dry for at least 5 minutes or longer, and then slowly peal, it works as expected. If you're applying all over, line first and then fill it. THICKLY. Once you peal it, it is NOT FINISHED. You have to take a cotton pad or washcloth and clean it up and blend. Then, if you applied all over, you will need to brush your teeth to make sure it's cleaned up. I usually take a q-tip and clean around my lips a second time to make sure it's perfect. Depending on how much stain I leave after cleaning it up and blending, it can last anywhere from a couple hours to all damn day. It really depends on how I did it. The color is gorgeous and nothing else compares in my opinion. I usually put a little elf stain over it if I'm just lining my lips with it. It looks beautiful and natural and there's nothing like it.Again, the bad reviews are from people that don't really know how to use it.

It is mess-free and cleans up easily with micellar water if you make a mistake while applying it. It helps to create a flawless look and is very easy to use. The SINamon shade is more on the red side, and not so much on the brownish/burnt orange side as it appears in the photo but that’s okay because it’s a pretty shade and blends well with lipstick/gloss. There is no sticky residue after peeling the liner off and doesn’t have any strong tastes or smells. It is a light texture and doesn’t feel heavy on my lips. I took away one star from my review because the first one I bought dried up in the tube pretty quickly after purchase but in all honesty, that could have been an error on my part. I may have not sealed it tightly enough at some point. So I can’t say that it is a product problem, but I thought I’d mention it so you’ll be aware that this can happen if you don’t close the tube tightly enough. Otherwise, I am very happy with this product and will be buying more shades in the future.

Here are my tips since I have been using these in different colors for 3 months:—make sure you get a color matching your lip color IF YOU want a natural lip contour. Nude matches my lip 1 to 1 and Pinked is slightly more pink so I use it for bolder looks.—You have to be very precise in application. This is a lip stain so by definition it will stain your lips. If your application is imprecise it will look like that. Do not touch it with your hands until it is dry and careful with your teeth; it will stain both.—make sure your lips do not have dead skin or that your lip hairs are shaved because it will stick to the dry skin and hairs!—a further tip for me: I apply a thin cost of Aquaphor (Vaseline will work too) and then apply this and it comes out so smooth and even more natural. Make sure you do not apply too much Aquaphor though.Trust me, if you find a right color and you master the application this product will make your daily life better","RK1JLRXD9SFRI","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yNYpbj2JL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"47 people found this helpful","Negative Reviewers Are Using This WRONG!!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK1JLRXD9SFRI/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BVPNQW1C","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFDBGC3NNXBZ6OHZAPSNFZCDWCUQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDBGC3NNXBZ6OHZAPSNFZCDWCUQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Size: 0.12 Fl Oz (Pack of 1), Color: nOOHde","B0BVPNQW1C","Size","0.12 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","Color","nOOHde",,

Although I think they do well I feel that my initially mentioned routine just zero pores pad plus Elemis resurfacing pads made my skin look better. These are okay but I still have a random dry patch and I don’t like that s visible under makeup. I use light coverage. So I think i ll go back to Elemis resurfacing pads and zero pores pads only. It was worth a try and still recommend them. But for my sensitive skin with redness tendencies and combination skin, I think my skin looked better. Not happy about the Elemis price though but oh well…I had a much more expensive subscription that in over 3 months I have not seen such good results as I’ve seen with medicube in 1 month. I cancelled that subscription and got all the products from medicube. For the first time in years my skin looks flawless under makeup, no patches of redness, dryness, etc. I use face cream and serums in addition to these products, but my skin didn’t look as good before, the only change in routine was adding the zero pore product. So I m going to give it the credit. Excited to try all the rest. I subscribed to all of them. All together are about the same price as 1 expensive one, that I didn’t not see many results with.","R24R1R6MNADSWT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10 people found this helpful","Amazing products for flawless skin","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24R1R6MNADSWT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09V7Z4TJG","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHO2WQSTBW7AZFIAJXX6C3ZUMH2A","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHO2WQSTBW7AZFIAJXX6C3ZUMH2A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Zero Pore Pads 2.0, 70 Pads, Size: 70 Count (Pack of 1)","B09V7Z4TJG","Color","Zero Pore Pads 2.0, 70 Pads","Size","70 Count (Pack of 1)",,

I read the product specs and reviews and looking at the more than reasonable price I bought them. Ironically the day I installed these one of my windshield washer nozzles broke (unrelated to this install) and so I was only getting a tiny trickle of washer fluid.

I have been so pleased with it that I currently have four of them on a variety of bikes. These hold the phone quite securely and I am never worried about losing it. I have never had a phone come loose or fall out of the holder while using these, not even close to coming out. The holder does feature a locking mechanism which is designed to hold the phone even more securely, but I have never had the need to utilize it. The feature is easily activated with a flip of a switch on the back side of the holder and is maybe useful for extremely aggressive mountain bike riding. It's nice to know it's there if you need it.

When I received my new Lamicall mount I realized that the ball socket from the old, failed, inferior mount fit the Lamicall receiver so in an effort to save me time and effort I just popped the new Lamicall cradle onto the old ball still mounted on the handle bars. After a couple of months that ball failed. Of course I was racing down a hill and the phone sailed off bouncing down the road. Thankfully it was locked in the Lamicall cradle and totally protected. There was zero damage!I hadn't remembered that shortcut I took with the old ball mount and thus reached out to Lamicall in an e-mail to see if I could get that part replaced. They promptly responded saying ""Please rest assured that we will take full responsibility for all quality related issues."" In the meantime I happened to be searching in my spare parts bin for something unrelated when I found the original Lamicall ball mount in it's box! That's when I realized my mistake. I shouldn't have cut that corner. The Lamicall ball mound is clearly better designed and I should have used it from the get-go. I highly recomend this phone mount, and I have gone through a gang of them. I'm confident this may be the last one.","R1ERQG4DU5ELUP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2 people found this helpful","Exceptionally well built product and backed up with great customer support!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ERQG4DU5ELUP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B085DMV7XD","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGJNZGJ3IPO7CKOISC2OQD2E4V2A","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJNZGJ3IPO7CKOISC2OQD2E4V2A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Black","B085DMV7XD","Color","Black",,,,

The 30-pack is perfect for my weekend camping trips—each packet’s a little brick that I toss into the tank after a dump, and it gets to work fast. I’ve got a basic portable toilet (about 5 gallons), and one drop-in handles a full day’s use for two people, breaking down waste and TP like promised. No clogs or sluggish flushes so far after a dozen uses.The orange scent is a big win—it’s strong enough to mask any stink without feeling like you’re sniffing a citrus air freshener factory. I was worried about odors in tight quarters, but these keep the tent trailer smelling clean, even in summer heat. They’re septic-safe too, which is clutch since I sometimes empty at campground facilities—no guilt there. The resealable bucket keeps them dry and easy to grab on the go.A couple notes: the orange dye stains the water a bit, which isn’t a problem but looks odd at first. Also, they dissolve quick—great for action, not so much if you’re pre-treating and letting it sit too long before use. Compared to liquid treatments I’ve tried, these drop-ins are less messy and more convenient, though you’ll burn through them faster in a bigger RV tank.For small camp toilets like mine, these are spot-on—effective, odor-busting, and hassle-free. I’d give them 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 for how well they fit my setup. Toss one in, and you’re good to go!","R2R1CACL6411Z7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7 people found this helpful","Camco TST MAX Toilet Treatment Drop-INs – Great for My Camp Toilet","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R1CACL6411Z7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016V2B1Z8","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEHE2A33FRTVQ2JYDYL2XYG2HBBA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEHE2A33FRTVQ2JYDYL2XYG2HBBA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Scent: Orange, Size: 30 Count (Pack of 1)","B016V2B1Z8","Scent","Orange","Size","30 Count (Pack of 1)",,

I'll really only be comparing the canned Celsius to the powder.At the current time, it's roughly $0.80 per serving vs $1.33/can serving (a Costco case) and up to probably $3 or more at a convenience store.So, it is absolutely delicious. I was kind of surprised the first time I tasted it. With any product's powder packets you can add to water, you can make it as dense or as watered-down as you like (customizable). I put 1 packet in my 40-ounce water bottle because I like a refreshing feeling/taste. In 40 ounces of water, my tastebuds say it's deliciously flavored water, not soda/juice. However, I could see people that hate that taste, and they would just put it in a standard sized plastic bottle to get the ultra-sweet, or non-water feel to it.There are a couple of additional benefits the way I drink it, in my opinion, that tie into each other. Because there is more water, naturally, I am getting more water intake, and it takes me longer to drink. Therefore, instead of getting 200 mg of caffeine at once and crashing, it is spread out over a much longer time period. I feel as though it's a much more sustained energy. And I used to drink 2 cans a day, but now I usually only have 1 (on my non-workout days) because it does what I need it to over a longer period of time. On my workout days, I will still generally have 1 for my workout and 1 for the day which is the same as what I do with the canned versions but the Celsius for the day lasts longer with the powder. I can't really do any of this with the carbonated cans because, for some reason, I just chug them.Additionally, since I am drinking more water, I feel like I eat less. I know caffeine is an appetite suppressant itself, but I am usually pretty content most of the day because I am full of water.  Again, this is in comparison to the cans and I don't seem to get as hungry. I do get hungry, just not ""hangry."" It's not a miracle drug or anything.Another benefit I just thought about is that it stays colder for longer since it's in my insulated water bottles. I live in Phoenix, so if I am outside in the middle of summer, this is kind of a big deal.The only 2 downsides so far.1. It seems to be that I go to the bathroom (#1, not #2) as much as I breathe. Okay, that's a little exaggerated, but it's a lot. However, I don't ever have to worry about having to pee in case I get popped for a drug test at work. lol2. Also, I now carry 2 large water bottles around because I'll carry 1 bottle for Celsius and 1 for water. This leads to having to wash them both at the end of the day (put them in the dishwasher). Again, both of these ""cons"" don't pale in comparison to the pros.I now have almost 2 cases of canned Celsius laying around because I swapped to the powder packets immediately. I will drink the cans to get rid of them but will likely never buy (the cans) again.UPDATE: The use of these just keeps getting better. I am travelling out of country for a month, and I don't believe the country I am going to is big on energy drinks. BUT, I can take a month's worth of Celsius with me (only adding a miniscule amount of weight and space in luggage) and not carry 3 cases of cans, which I would never do anyway. Another reviewer had mentioned this already, but I was so happy I didn't have to worry about my Celsius addiction in another country and wanted to let you guys know that they are ultra-portable.UPDATE UPDATE: Over a year later and it's still my favorite drink.","R1ITVH6LMOLHLJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"105 people found this helpful","Great Value, Delicious and Customizable","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ITVH6LMOLHLJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XB745PC","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024",,,"amzn1.account.AGRNU247WP7OXIY2NS2NXKNDPTNQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGRNU247WP7OXIY2NS2NXKNDPTNQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Flavor Name: Dragonfruit Lime, Size: 2.8 Ounce (Pack of 1)","B07XB745PC","Flavor Name","Dragonfruit Lime","Size","2.8 Ounce (Pack of 1)",,

It comes with a very nice user guide that explains how all the screens work.  The display is in black and white, but has good resolution and offers several real-time graphing functions.  The menu and set-up screens are intuitive.  Once I got started, I had no problem navigating through the displays.  I was able to view all the data I wanted to see, and was able to reset all of the codes that were causing lit trouble lights on the dashboard.

Anthony Mackie and Harrison Ford did a tremendous job doing their part, Sam Wilson’s, Captain America main goal was to clear up Isaiah Bradleys crimes, who was framed by The Leader, meanwhile President Ross was struggling to find peace and unity with all different countries who are all fighting over fighting over Adamantium but over the years he was working with the leader to help him, survive and get through his election and eventually ultimately turning Ross into the Red Hulk. Although Sam is taking up the mantle of Captain America, he does have this song doubt that he doesn’t deserve it but Bucky a.k.a. the winter soldier told him that Steve chose him for a reason because he saw that he was a good man and would see the good in the people, and to give the people to believe in something. Also, I like Joaquin as the new Falcon, he was very fun to watch. Overall, the movie is a good watch and you should definitely give it a try if you are a big Captain America fan or I’ve never watched a Marvel movie just want to start anyway. Don’t listen to any crybabies or grifters tell you otherwise at this film is horrible, because the film is not that bad, just have fun. 💪🏽🇺🇸","R2QUI7WEROBE62","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nPhuxo2iL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518d+BXomOL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i5u8nTKyL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3 people found this helpful","CAPTAIN AMERICA BRAVE NEW WORLD GOOD MARVEL MOVIE","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QUI7WEROBE62/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F4B7C7FH","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFHJNGDVMNNP44T7ENRERMWKHF7Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFHJNGDVMNNP44T7ENRERMWKHF7Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F4B7C7FH",,,,,,

Although it wasn’t as hard hitting as Winter Soldier, fresh as The First Avenger or as cameo filled as Civil War, Brave New World opens up the cinematic universe into the realm of “what will happen next!?!”Many complaints about the film are unjustified. No action, boring dialogue and missed opportunities. I disagree on all accounts.The action continues throughout the entirety of its near two hour length, the story reveals itself by way of Cap searching for the real threat and the discovery of a new element has just opened the world up to so much potential.There were a couple of moments that seemed to pander to the audience, but those moments weren’t all that intrusive anyway. There is only one scene during the credits, quite unnecessary in all honesty, and it is by far the weakest part of the whole. Other than that, the movie is fun, lively and makes for a fantastic addition to an already wonderful cinematic universe.Bring on the Thunderbolts!","R3T2ULE94NVB7O",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"8 people found this helpful","Set after Eternals and before Thunderbolts","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T2ULE94NVB7O/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F4B7C7FH","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGCAW2SYGTGXY2ISEAFKO7Q5BJEQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCAW2SYGTGXY2ISEAFKO7Q5BJEQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F4B7C7FH",,,,,,

The film picks up following the events of the Disney+ television series “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” as well as continuing on from the “Captain America” and “Avengers” films. In the story, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) now works as Captain America and is aided by Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), the new Falcon. They find themselves drawn into a spy game following the election of Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford, replacing the late William Hurt) to the Presidency and the geopolitical ramifications of the discovery of adamantium in the Celestial Island left over from the events of Chloé Zhao’s 2021 film, “Eternals.” The film sets up a race for resources with Japan and the United States as the largest players in the contest. President Ross and Cap have their own rocky history, made all the worse when a trigger sets off Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) at a White House reception, forcing Cap to help capture his old friend while also figuring out what the President is hiding.The film introduces Sidewinder (Giancarlo Esposito) and Copperhead (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson) as members of Serpent, thereby using an early story idea for the third Cap film before it was changed to “Civil War.” While other Marvel projects have hearkened back to Louis Leterrier’s 2008 film, “The Incredible Hulk,” hoping to demonstrate the importance of the second entry in the MCU through cameos in Destin Daniel Cretton’s 2021 film, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” and Jessica Gao’s 2022 Disney+ series, “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,” Onah uses “Brave New World” to tie together the most threads from “Incredible Hulk” with Thaddeus Ross’ prominent role, the return of Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) who had his brain exposed to gamma in “Incredible Hulk,” and a brief cameo from Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Just as “Civil War” was both a Cap film and an Iron Man film, “Brave New World” is both a Cap film and a Hulk film.At times, the political thriller elements struggle to hold suspense since the film’s marketing gave away several of the biggest twists. Harrison Ford gives one of his best dramatic performance, imbuing the character with more pathos than William Hurt had been able to do in previous films (not due to a lack on Hurt’s part, but because of how those prior films used the character). For his part, Anthony Mackie continues to demonstrate why he was the right person to take up the shield and become Cap. He shows mercy, compassion, and introspection even as he’s delivers fantastically choreographed and athletic fight scenes. Shira Haas rounds out the cast as Ruth Bat-Seraph, who Onah reimagines as a former Black Widow. Changes to the character’s origin and costume help with some of the controversy surrounding her inclusion given current real-world events. Further, the character’s initial debut in the “Hulk” comics adds to the role of the Hulk mythos in this movie. Unfortunately, the film doesn’t make her a mutant and thus misses the opportunity to use both her inclusion and the appearance of adamantium to further lay the groundwork for the X-Men. Overall, “Brave New World” is an enjoyable film with Anthony Mackie shining as Cap, but the film struggles to balance several subplots and could have used the political thriller elements to greater effect as an allegory for our own political situation. Ford’s portrayal of President Ross and the parallels to “The Manchurian Candidate” work particularly well.This Blu-Ray/4K steelbook is a great way for Cap fans to add this film to their collection. It includes featurettes about Anthony Macke’s portrayal of Sam Wilson over the years, a look at Sam’s greatest foes, a gag reel, deleted scenes, and audio commentary. I do wish there was more about the effects both practical and digital as well as an inclusion of art cards like Marvel has done in the past. The art on the packaging is particularly nice and recalls some of the current posters for John Frankenheimer’s 1962 film, “The Manchurian Candidate.”","R1IM1KZ6GGIYVM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fun, but Often Balancing Too Many Plot Threads","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IM1KZ6GGIYVM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F4B7C7FH","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGEKA6WODQNV3G5QBLHTEBDDZNQA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEKA6WODQNV3G5QBLHTEBDDZNQA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F4B7C7FH",,,,,,
