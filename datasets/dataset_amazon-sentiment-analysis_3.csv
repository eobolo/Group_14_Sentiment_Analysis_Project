Prepare to be regaled with the tale of how a humble mini monocular telescope transformed this landlubber into a swashbuckling sovereign of the skies – a bona fide bird-watching pirate!Before I acquired this pocket-sized marvel, my bird-watching endeavors were about as successful as a screen door on a submarine. I'd squint, I'd guess, and I'd mostly just identify blurry blobs as ""probably a bird."" My identification skills peaked at ""yep, that one's brown.""But then, like a treasure chest unearthed on a deserted isle, this mini monocular sailed into my life. Small enough to fit in my spyglass (er, pocket), yet mighty enough to bring the feathered fiends into glorious, glorious focus. Suddenly, those blurry blobs had plumage! I could discern the cheeky glint in a robin's eye, the imperious stare of a blue jay, and the delicate, almost judgmental, twitch of a hummingbird's beak.Now, when I venture into the wilds of my backyard (or the slightly less wild local park), I don my imaginary eye patch, hoist my tiny telescope, and become ""One-Eyed Ollie, the Avian Avenger!"" I stalk through the undergrowth (okay, maybe just the petunias), my monocular glued to my good eye, muttering pirate-y observations.""Shiver me timbers, look at that cardinal's crimson coat!""""Ahoy, matey! That nuthatch is walkin' down the tree trunk like a scurvy dog!""""Blast and barnacles! Did that sparrow just steal a crumb the size of a doubloon?""My neighbors now eye me with a mixture of amusement and concern, especially when I start making squawking noises in response to a particularly chatty chickadee. But do I care? Nay! For I have seen the iridescent shimmer of a grackle's feathers up close! I have witnessed the acrobatic feats of a goldfinch mid-flight! These are treasures no gold can buy!The only downside? My parrot keeps trying to steal my ""shiny lookin' tube."" I suspect he thinks it's a new kind of cracker.So, if you too yearn to explore the avian archipelago with clarity and a dash of buccaneering bravado, I heartily recommend this mini monocular. Just be prepared to answer some curious glances and maybe invest in a good eye patch. Arrr!

    This microscope is very impressive as it displays and takes high quality photos and videos of really small stuff. The resolution of the photo taken is HD measuring in at 1920 x 1080 pixels and the videos are the same size at 30 frames per second. The photos and videos are date and time stamped but I had not set the date before doing many photos and videos. This microscope is addictive as I'll place it down to be surprised and then move on to another object with the same reaction.  The microscope has three light settings so I can adjust the amount of light while viewing the image on screen for a better view. The microscope works super on a flat surface and that is where I got my best views and photos.All my photos and videos were captured on the included TF card. The card that I got was only 16GB versus the reported 32GB on the webpage but the microscope converts the photos to JPG making all the photos very small in file size meaning, the card will hold 1,000s of photos. Speaking of format, the videos recorded in the microscope are AVI format which can be viewed on any PC.  The TF card can be tricky to get in and out of its slot as the card goes in deep and fingers are just too large to access it. Any pointed object can help to insert or pop the TF card. The USB C port is located right beside the TF slot and does not have a cover plate so dirt and debris will find its way in so I added a USB C plug. Speaking of the USB C port, the microscope is powered by a built-in battery that is charged via that USB C port and the microscope will continue to work while being charged. Charging the microscope from Low Power to 100% takes 1 hour and 47 minutes.The last important thing is the unicorn silicone cover can be removed and the microscope works perfectly so this microscope can be used by any age.","R2AAJDTRFT1F9T",,,,,,,"Outstanding Portable Microscope for any age",,"Reviewed in Canada on March 29, 2025",,,,,"","B0DS47WYKD",,,,

I thought this might be more of a novelty item with flair appeal, but image you can get is remarkably clear.  You do have to be right up to the item and manipulating the device to get optimal viewing is necessary but it is oh so simple.  This is like a magnifying glass, a microscope and a recording tool all in one.-USB-C cable for charging is included, as well as 32GB memory card.  I upgrade to a 64 GB memory card that I had lying around so it is a possibility for those wanting to improve storage capacity.The asking price of $40 CAD is not unreasonable.-No batteries, which I prefer in products that could easily be left in a drawer for a month or 6 without being used, which reduces the risk of leaking batteries.CONS-I wish this was available in other colours/themes and in fact I think the unicorn theme may actually limit the appeal of this item.  We showed this to a 6 year old girl, an 8 year old girl and the a 12 year old boy and the the latter was probably the most interested in it and was thinking of items he could use with it such as his coin collection and inspecting for wear on some Pokemon cards.-I was not able to check out the quality of any memory card captures because the kids left home before we could examine any of the contents.  I will try to get more information and update this review accordingly.-No charging adapter included.-While I think this is reasonably priced and we had fun with it for an afternoon, I am not sure how long this will interest kids who may very well put it down within a few minutes or find the appeal quite limited.  I realize this is true of most products you could gift to young people, but one of the girls for instance had no interest in this whatsoever so the value derived from this device will vary considerably from person to person.","R24403NABXMENC",,,,,,,"Surprising performance, but did may be of limited use/interest to children.",,"Reviewed in Canada on March 31, 2025",,,,,"","B0DS47WYKD",,,,

Each flower has a loose sketch and minimal instructions that include an example and suggested colors to use. The pigments are pretty vibrant for an affordable kit. Not premium quality, but also not kindergarten variety either. The brush leaves a little to be desired. I would have preferred a traditional round brush that had a fine tapered tip. The brush that is included is better for acrylics, but it is what I used when painting the hydrangea so it is certainly possible to use. It just doesn't hold water like a typical watercolor brush and doesn't lend itself to puddling or washes. I would say that this workbook is less about brush technique and more about mixing and playing with colors. Also, understanding how important negative space is and leaving areas of the paper untouched. I should have left more white areas in my flower. As a learning tool, or just a fun exploration, I think this is a very nice set.I think this would be a good gift for beginners if they are curious and don't need perfection. For those who want each flower to be frameable, the instructions might not be as in depth as they would like. As someone who has some experience painting, I think this would be fantastic to take on vacation. Small projects that don't require a great deal of thought but still offer the relaxation and enjoyment of painting.

It gives a defined, clean look without feeling stiff or crunchy, and the light brown shade is definitely on the warmer side, so keep that in mind if you're more ash-toned.It's not for super rushed mornings (unless you're a brow wizard), but with a little patience and a soft hand, it really does give a great finish. It really needs time to set or else you'll have issues like other reviewers did. Also... pro tip: don’t go straight from pump to face unless you want villain-brow realness.Would I say it’s perfect?

It was in a box with other things which were not damaged (nor was the shipping box) so it must have happened before it was packed.  I don't know if that's why I can't get them to focus or if I'm just doing something wrong. I can focus each side individually, but not together.  When I try to look through both sides at once the field of vision is bluish.It came with instructions for focusing (yes I followed them but no luck) but did not come with instructions to assemble the tripod and phone attachment it came with.  The instructions don't say anything about the night vision either, and there is nothing to indicate it actually has night vision.The pictures in the product description make it look like the tripod attaches to the binocs - there is no way for them to do so.The storage bag isn't big enough to hold the tripod or attachments so that defeats the purpose of a storage bag.  After some creative packing, I was able to get everything but the tripod in the bag.  I slid the strap over one leg, then laid the strap across the top and closed the flap.  Then I took the strap back over the top and looped it around the top of the tripod.  Now it will all be together at least.  Bag doesn't have any pockets which would be nice.Given the price, I would not recommend this product until they make improvements to storage, make focusing easier, explain the night vision, and provide full instructions.","R3RE4TBOI7N93K","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nJ3m-CVTL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vvFEAJohL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NuZvBw+PL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dGNcYN7cL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DcgWZvcRL._SY88.jpg",,"I cant get it focused and the storage bag doesn't hold eveerything","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RE4TBOI7N93K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DKXTBDJ1","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFCIDILWFITLCMDNZQMUE7QRVAXQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCIDILWFITLCMDNZQMUE7QRVAXQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DKXTBDJ1",,,,

So, don't blame the binoculars for the clarity. Blame the screen and the impossibility of keeping both things perfectly still while holding them like that. What's important is that those geese are about 70/75 feet away.I live on a lake and am often out watching the birds, usually much smaller ones than these, so I was happy to be offered another set of binoculars. This is my third set in use right now, and I was particularly glad about the night vision. I did pull all the blackout curtains and the night vision does work well, but I'm not going to bother getting you a picture of that because trying all that again in the dark will likely lead to catastrophe. :)The construction is very sturdy. They feel much more durable than I expected and there's a very nice attention to detail. Even the lens caps feel professional. It had completely slipped my mind that they also came with a tripod and mounting hardware. All around, this is a fantastic package. If I had to complain about anything, it would be the case. It's fine, but as I said I spend a lot of time outside and it's not heavily padded. It's perfectly suitable for standard protection if you're not a butter fingers.The focus is very easy to adjust and very precise. Great distance binoculars true to their magnification specs with a bunch of toys to go with them. I got more than I expected and am very happy with them. If you've got an amateur set and are looking at these for a little more magnification, I can't imagine you finding much wrong with them.

Those same concepts are then reiterated, listed out as instructions, as you practice painting each image in the book.The paints that are included do seem to be high quality. They're fairly opaque, true to color, and glide nicely onto the paper. The paper is also high quality - very similar to watercolor paper I purchased from my local art store for a past project. I only received one of two paint brushes - the skinny one - and it was similar to what's included in paint-by-number kits. Fortunately, I have other brushes on hand and used one of those whenever I needed something with a wider head, but the skinny brush did a decent job, too.The spiral binding is helpful, too, allowing you to place the workbook completely flat while painting, with the instructions right there to easily follow along.So far I've successfully painted two birds, both of which I'm really happy with, and I do feel like I'm finally learning how to paint with watercolor!","R2G5ZTJ6M1VEZZ","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LEjRTgfgL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pPeA96+lL._SY88.jpg",,,,"5 people found this helpful","Finally Learning How To Paint With Watercolor","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G5ZTJ6M1VEZZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F2J33CFB","Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AH5FO4VRVF6WEZIFUBPX3DE34QEQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH5FO4VRVF6WEZIFUBPX3DE34QEQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","Color: Birds","B0F2J33CFB","Color","Birds",,

But the screen looked like I had wiped it over with a dirty dish cloth,  I smoothed it down more but you could still see it.  I compared the screen to my Paperwhite and was really disappointed, no way near as crisp as it.  Was about to box the Scribe back up but I thought I would life the corner of the screen protector up and see what it looked like with out it.  It looked amazing.The best way to describe it is its like reading through frosted glass,  if you don't have another device to compare it with you would not notice, but when you take it off you see how much it reduces the quality.I will leave it on whilst I play with the pen, but will be coming off in an hour or 2 for me to read.","R2JHX85JTERM4I",,,,,,,"Not made by Amazon and like reading through frosted glass.",,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on March 27, 2025",,,,,"","B0DKV8YKCH",,,,

That holds a little under one half gallon so you get quite a bit of ice out of it. It's nice and light , and it is very quiet until it dumps the ice , but that lets you know the ice has been dumped. It will keep making ice as long as you keep putting water in it.

And if you don't have Marvel Legends Hulk figure yet, that is what you will probably end paying for an older one on the used market, so then yeah it is a good value. Overall, I like it. It poses well and will be a great addition to the living room superheroes battles when I play with my grand kids when they visit. Overall I am happy with this figure and am glad that I got it.","RRKAHSS1H85QA",,,,,,,"Questionable","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRKAHSS1H85QA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DJCHDN93","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AETIAJW4ONULFO4V7MXO7SHSI7XA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETIAJW4ONULFO4V7MXO7SHSI7XA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DJCHDN93",,,,

As a longtime fan of both the WNBA and Panini's Prizm line, I had high hopes for this release. Unfortunately, the experience turned out to be quite a letdown—mainly due to the poor condition in which the product arrived.Right out of the shipping box, I noticed the Blaster Box itself was dented on multiple corners, and the seal looked like it had been under pressure. Once I opened it, I saw that the individual card packs were loosely packed and had clearly shifted around during shipping. A few packs had noticeable creases, and some cards inside had bent or soft corners. For a product marketed toward collectors, that’s a big problem.Card condition is a huge part of the hobby, and when several cards are damaged before you even open the pack, it really kills the excitement. I did pull a couple of parallels and inserts, but they weren’t of any big-name players—and even those had some minor edge wear, so they're not grading candidates. That was disappointing, especially considering the premium that Panini products usually carry.I will say the card design this year looks great—clean layout, vibrant colors, and nice photo selection. If you’re lucky enough to get a mint box, you might have a better experience. But between the subpar packaging, lackluster pulls, and damaged cards, this was not worth the money. I expected better from Panini.I’d recommend waiting for a restock in-store where you can check the condition, or skip this one unless you're a die-hard WNBA fan.","R37ZZIVD3TMCYN",,,,,,,"2024 Panini PRIZM WNBA Basketball Blaster Box","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37ZZIVD3TMCYN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F3HQ19SY","Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AEDFDKIODHQSLQYGURCJ636SCTIA","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEDFDKIODHQSLQYGURCJ636SCTIA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F3HQ19SY",,,,

To my surprise, I thought it was simply lovely. I loved that all the actors singing performances were not pre-recorded, and the actors sang the songs live on camera. The Visuals were beautiful, I was expecting not to like the Actress playing Snow White, but she was not bad at all. Andrew Burnap who plays Jonathan (he played Snow White's love interest) was very handsome, charming and had a lovely voice. The duets when he and Snow White were singing together were perfect. Not to mention Dopey such a cute character <3 of course this goes without saying but the incredible CGI was out of this world. The animals and their expressions were what Disney is all about, the warmth and emotions that they bring to life is just outstanding and heartwarming. The actual thing I thought was bad about the movie was “Gal Gadot’s Performance”. She simply did not fit well as the role of the Evil Queen. She might be The Best Wonder Woman, but her acting was not great, terrible actually. Especially if you compare her to Charlize Theron which her acting as the Evil Queen on the 2012 movie was outstanding.Now regarding the Steelbook, the North America Disney SteelBooks usually come with a “Full Gloss Finish”. This does give it a classy look, the Vibrant Colors are highlighted by this finish on Disney Steelbooks. Both Art chosen for the Front and the Back of the Steelbook are gorgeous. It is worth mentioning also that international copies like in the UK will in fact  only come with a Spott Gloss Finish. The Full Gloss finish that we are getting on this Limited Edition Steelbook makes it worth buying this edition from Amazon.com. As well, for the UK and Some other countries they have on the “UHD/Blu-ray Disks Artworks” the “Rating Logos” which kinda removes the nice and clean look of the Disks Artwork that we are Getting. Do not take it for Granted this is a nice touch that we are getting from the US SteelBook Edition. We of course don’t have this SteelBook “in hands” yet, but it will be a very Nice and Glossy one. I can’t wait to get my hands on this little Gem.","R58JF2WSM4LBM",,,,,,"20 people found this helpful","Simply Lovely","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R58JF2WSM4LBM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0F7X44PTD","Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AGLD62RR76BKZQCRI3FZZEFGRVQQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLD62RR76BKZQCRI3FZZEFGRVQQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0F7X44PTD",,,,

I was hooked! 4/5 stars at first glance! Instant buy! But then i actually read thru the Amazon Renewed reviews, and was immediately horrified. Based on the reviews, it seemed like every Elite Series 2 controller was arriving in terrible shape, with missing and broken parts, improper charging cables, and absolutely filthy. My heart sank into my stomach...I'm a gamer on a budget, so i thought this was a great deal, but read the reviews and prepared for the worst. I even explained my situation and concerns to a local Gamestop employee and got him to set aside an Elite Series 2 box for me in case this Amazon Renewed one came dead on arrival.Then, the moment came to unbox. I was pleasantly surprised to see the carrying case was included and in excellent condition. Opened it up, and the suspense was tangible as i examined the contents and tested the controller...It worked PERFECTLY! No missing parts! No broken parts! No filthy controller! There was a tiny bit of skin flakes i had to use a needle to even get to, but after 4 disinfectant wipes and 30 minutes with the needle, i got that baby looking brand spanking new!!!Couldn't be happier with the purchase!

I understand there maybe some wear on the item and 3rd party accessories (like charger cord) however when you say they are tested I would expect there to be no issues with the controllers. Both controllers had issues though both were different. The first one had an issue with the 4 way controller in that it would drift up after being pressed down and stick. That one was rather clean and had the original charger cord, however I sent it back (MISTAKE) the replacement for that was worse!! It wasn't as clean, the charger cord was 3rd party but it was MUCH shorter--if you are going to use a 3rd party item at least make it the close to the same as you can. This controller itself the flip paddles on the back the give on the top placement for short flippers was way off and couldn't be used. If I placed larger flippers it worked fine but then I couldn't use the bottom ones --so in a sense I lost 2 of the 4 extra control features.I contacted the seller and the 1st exchange went well--the 2nd they never responded so I just am sending it back for a refund and will save the extra 100 to get a new custom one.","RJ1WUGHQZ3H66",,,,,,"10 people found this helpful","Item itself is good but not this company's refurbishment version","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ1WUGHQZ3H66/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08PCBDR2D","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2021",,,"amzn1.account.AGSNTULBP4QP4BRQ5EPHX7GMGA3A","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGSNTULBP4QP4BRQ5EPHX7GMGA3A/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B08PCBDR2D",,,,

However, this year’s winner, Anora, is a baffling choice that undermines the very standards that define an Oscar-worthy film. From its lackluster plot to its amateur execution, Anora is an insult to the legacy of past winners and a disservice to audiences who expect cinematic brilliance.A Plot That Goes NowhereOne of Anora’s most glaring flaws is its complete absence of a compelling narrative. The film meanders aimlessly, offering no real tension, depth, or stakes to keep the audience engaged. Characters are introduced without meaningful development, and the so-called “plot” is riddled with inconsistencies and uninspired twists that feel forced rather than organic. If a story is the backbone of a film, Anora is spineless.Direction and Editing: A Masterclass in MediocrityThe direction is equally underwhelming, with scenes that feel hastily stitched together, lacking any sense of rhythm or coherence. The cinematography fails to elevate the film, relying on generic framing and uninspired shots that add nothing to the viewing experience. The editing is choppy and erratic, making certain sequences feel jarring and disconnected, as if the filmmakers themselves were unsure of what they were trying to achieve.Acting That Feels HollowA strong cast can often redeem a weak script, but Anora offers no such saving grace. Performances range from overacted melodrama to lifeless monotony, making it difficult to form any emotional connection with the characters. Moments that are meant to be profound or moving instead come across as awkward and forced, draining the film of any sincerity.An Oscar-Worthy Film? Absolutely NotTo put it bluntly, Anora does not deserve a place among the greats. It lacks the ambition, creativity, and execution that define Oscar-winning films. Its victory is a slap in the face to classics like Schindler’s List, The Godfather, or Parasite, which showcased true artistic vision and craftsmanship. The Academy’s decision to crown this mess as the best film of the year is not just disappointing—it’s embarrassing.Final VerdictWhile film is subjective and different audiences may take away different meanings from a movie, Anora simply fails on too many levels to be considered a worthy Oscar winner. Instead of setting new standards for excellence, it drags the prestige of the award down. If this is the direction the Academy is heading, it may be time to rethink what truly defines cinematic greatness.","R3MD7DO9DJG09V",,,,,,"75 people found this helpful","A Disappointing Oscar Win: Why Anora Falls Flat","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MD7DO9DJG09V/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DTB8D9QL","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AFB5UEBZWPFOURSTR6CBFPPM333Q","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFB5UEBZWPFOURSTR6CBFPPM333Q/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DTB8D9QL",,,,

First part is endless vignettes of Ani and Ivan getting it on—much footage of Ani displaying her gorgeous body. Ohboy, did the director and Academy Bigwigs have fun with this part. Yes, said vignettes are building their relationship, such as it is, but ENDLESS. Second part is ENDLESS replay of the same scene, heroine struggles with badish guys who demand to know where Ivan has run off to. Third part is ENDLESS vignettes of the hunt for Ivan. Fourth part, we confront the family and have actual dialogue and storytelling. Excellent, but watching it I do not think Best Picture.Best Editing? The actual shot by shot editing was good, often clever, but suffered from the ENDLESSNESS of the first three parts.Best Script???????? The first three quarters of the movie has maybe a couple of dozen lines repeated in ENDLESS variations with f***ing being every third word. I don’t mind verisimilitude. I mind f***ing boring. Fourth part very well written.Best Actress? Maybe. She embodied the role beautifully. I haven’t seen the other performances. Ivan was also a great, flashy performance and the bodyguard Igor was beautifully underplayed.Best Movie??????????????????? See above. My husband and I were just baffled. If it hadn't won all those Oscars, I would probably have quit after 10 minutes.","RM6U1WSSDTZCT",,,,,,"20 people found this helpful","The Academy lost its mind","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM6U1WSSDTZCT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DTB8D9QL","Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2025",,,"amzn1.account.AHPZYOOF7J3MKKOJF6ZN2TGYSXAQ","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHPZYOOF7J3MKKOJF6ZN2TGYSXAQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8","","B0DTB8D9QL",,,,

The first 20 minutes is soft porn, which then evolves into a love story. Then comes the body of the film which is hilarious comedy. It then turns into emotional drama until its unsatisfying ending. More than unsatisfying, it was a terrible ending. I guess its Best Picture Oscar nomination is plausible, but not its win. (A matter of taste, granted. But ""Conclave"" was much more deserving.) As for the disc itself, the quality is beautiful as expected.
